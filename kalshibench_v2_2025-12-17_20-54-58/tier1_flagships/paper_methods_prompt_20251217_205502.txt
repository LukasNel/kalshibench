### Category Distribution
- Number of Categories: 13
- Category Entropy: 3.01 bits (measures diversity)
- Largest Category: Sports
- Smallest Category: Science and Technology
- Full Distribution:
{
  "Sports": 83,
  "Politics": 55,
  "Entertainment": 47,
  "Companies": 30,
  "Elections": 24,
  "Mentions": 19,
  "Crypto": 11,
  "Climate and Weather": 9,
  "Financials": 8,
  "World": 6,
  "Economics": 4,
  "Social": 3,
  "Science and Technology": 1
}

### Question Complexity
- Question Length: mean=61, median=58, std=26 chars
- Description Length: mean=442, median=406 chars
- Vocabulary Size: 2,224 unique words
- Avg Words per Question: 85.8


### Data Source
- Platform: Kalshi (CFTC-regulated prediction market)
- Dataset: 2084Collective/kalshibench-v2
- Total questions evaluated: 300

### Temporal Filtering
- Knowledge cutoff: 2025-10-01
- All questions resolve AFTER this date to prevent memorization
- This is critical for fair evaluation of models with different training cutoffs

### Categories Present
[
  "Crypto",
  "Social",
  "Financials",
  "Climate and Weather",
  "Mentions",
  "Elections",
  "Sports",
  "Companies",
  "Politics",
  "World",
  "Economics",
  "Entertainment",
  "Science and Technology"
]

### Ground Truth Distribution
- Yes: 120
- No: 180

### Evaluation Protocol
1. Each model receives the question text and description
2. Models must provide:
   - Binary prediction (yes/no)
   - Confidence score (0-100%)
   - Reasoning
3. Responses parsed using XML tags: <think>, <answer>, <confidence>

### Metrics
**Classification:**
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 (per-class and macro)

**Calibration:**
- Brier Score: Mean squared error between predicted probability and outcome
- Brier Skill Score: Improvement over climatological baseline
- ECE (Expected Calibration Error): Weighted average of |confidence - accuracy| per bin
- MCE (Maximum Calibration Error): Worst-calibrated bin
- ACE (Adaptive Calibration Error): ECE with equal-mass bins
- Log Loss: Cross-entropy loss (penalizes confident wrong predictions)

**Confidence Analysis:**
- Overconfidence rates at 70%, 80%, 90% thresholds
- Average confidence when correct vs wrong

### Models Evaluated
[]

Write a formal Methods section (3-4 paragraphs) suitable for NeurIPS covering:
1. Benchmark construction and rationale (USE THE DATASET ANALYSIS STATS!)
2. Evaluation protocol and metrics
3. Model selection criteria
4. Description of the dataset characteristics (temporal span, category diversity, question complexity)
