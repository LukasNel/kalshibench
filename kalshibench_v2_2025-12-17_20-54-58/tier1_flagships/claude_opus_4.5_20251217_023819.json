NFL regular season structure: The NFL regular season consists of 17 games per team (as of the 2021 expansion from 16 games).\n\n2. To win more than 16 games means winning at least 17 games, which would require going undefeated (17-0) in the regular season.\n\n3. Historical context: No NFL team has ever gone undefeated in a 17-game regular season. The 1972 Miami Dolphins went 14-0 in a 14-game season. The 2007 New England Patriots went 16-0 in a 16-game season but lost the Super Bowl. Since the expansion to 17 games, no team has gone 17-0.\n\n4. Philadelphia Eagles recent performance: The Eagles have been competitive recently. In 2022-23, they went 14-3 and made the Super Bowl. In 2023-24, they had a disappointing season after a strong start. In 2024-25, they had a strong season, going 14-3 in the regular season.\n\n5. Base rate: Going 17-0 is extraordinarily rare. Even the best teams typically lose 1-3 games per season due to injuries, scheduling, divisional games, and general variance.\n\n6. The probability of any team going undefeated in a 17-game season is extremely low - probably less than 1% even for elite teams.\n\nGiven that this requires a perfect 17-0 regular season record, which has never been achieved in the 17-game era and is historically extremely rare, the answer should be \"no\" with high confidence.",

Home advantage in Liga MX is significant, with home teams generally winning around 40-45% of matches.\n\n2. **Historical performance**: Both Santos Laguna and Pachuca are traditionally strong Liga MX clubs. Santos Laguna has won multiple Liga MX titles, as has Pachuca. They're relatively evenly matched historically.\n\n3. **Base rates for Liga MX**: In a typical Liga MX match:\n   - Home win: ~40-45%\n   - Draw: ~25-30%\n   - Away win: ~25-30%\n\n4. **Current form**: Since this match is in November 2025 (future from my knowledge cutoff), I don't have information about current form or standings for the 2025-26 season.\n\n5. **Head-to-head**: Historically, matches between these teams have been competitive with no dominant side.\n\nGiven that Santos Laguna would likely be playing at home (Estadio Corona in Torre\u00f3n), they would have a slight advantage. However, with three possible outcomes (home win, draw, away win), the probability of a Santos Laguna win is likely around 35-45%.\n\nSince the question asks specifically if Santos Laguna wins (not including draws or Pachuca wins), and draws are relatively common in Liga MX, I'd estimate the probability of a Santos Laguna win at approximately 35-40%.\n\nThis means the outcome is more likely to be \"no\" (either a draw or Pachuca win) than \"yes\" (Santos Laguna win).",

This significantly changes his availability and the types of media appearances he makes.\n\n2. **All-In Podcast background**: The All-In Podcast is hosted by Jason Calacanis, Chamath Palihapitiya, David Sacks, and David Friedberg - prominent tech investors. David Sacks has been appointed to a role in the Trump administration (AI & Crypto Czar), which creates a direct connection.\n\n3. **Trump's media strategy**: Trump has historically been willing to appear on podcasts and alternative media. During his 2024 campaign, he appeared on several podcasts including Joe Rogan's podcast, which was a major event.\n\n4. **Political alignment**: The All-In hosts, particularly Chamath and Sacks, have shown some alignment with Trump or at least openness to his policies. Sacks actively supported Trump in 2024.\n\n5. **Presidential constraints**: Sitting presidents typically have limited time for podcast appearances, though Trump has broken many norms. He might prioritize more traditional media or his own rallies.\n\n6. **The hosts' interest**: Given their connections to the administration (especially Sacks), the hosts would likely want to have Trump on. They've had other political figures before.\n\n7. **Time remaining**: We're in 2025, so there's substantial time for this to happen.\n\n8. **Base rate**: Presidents rarely do long-form podcast interviews while in office, but Trump appeared on Rogan during his campaign. The question is whether he'd do it as a sitting president.\n\nGiven David Sacks' direct involvement in the Trump administration, there's a stronger-than-usual connection. However, a sitting president appearing on a podcast is still relatively unusual. Trump might do a brief appearance or interview, but a full podcast episode is less certain.\n\nI'd estimate there's maybe a 35-45% chance this happens.

      "reasoning": "This question asks whether Shkendija Tetovo will win against Jagiellonia Bialystok in a UEFA Conference League match scheduled for November 6, 2025.\n\nLet me consider the relevant factors:\n\n1. **Team Quality**: Jagiellonia Bialystok is a Polish top-flight team that has been competitive in European competitions. They won the Polish Ekstraklasa in 2023-24, which qualified them for European football. Shkendija Tetovo is from North Macedonia's top division - a significantly weaker league in terms of UEFA coefficients and overall quality.\n\n2. **UEFA Coefficient**: Poland's league coefficient is substantially higher than North Macedonia's. Polish clubs generally perform better in European competitions.\n\n3. **Home/Away**: The match appears to be Shkendija Tetovo at home (listed first).

Tom Hanks has been the subject of various conspiracy theories, particularly from QAnon circles, but these have been thoroughly debunked. He has never been credibly accused of any connection to Epstein or his activities.\n\n2. **What documents might be released**: The question refers to federal government documents regarding Epstein. Various court documents have been released over the years, including flight logs, deposition transcripts, and other legal materials. More documents could potentially be released in 2025.\n\n3. **Who has appeared in documents**: People who have appeared in Epstein documents include those who flew on his plane, visited his properties, were mentioned in legal proceedings, or were otherwise connected. Many names that appeared were not necessarily involved in any wrongdoing - some were simply acquaintances, business contacts, or mentioned tangentially.\n\n4. **Base rate consideration**: Many celebrities and public figures have been falsely rumored to be in Epstein documents.

      "reasoning": "Let me analyze this prediction about Tez Johnson recording 4+ receptions in a Tampa Bay at Buffalo NFL game scheduled for November 16, 2025.\n\nFirst, I need to identify who Tez Johnson is. Tez Johnson was a wide receiver at Oregon who entered the 2025 NFL Draft. He was drafted by the Buffalo Bills in the 2025 NFL Draft (4th round, pick 109).\n\nSo this is asking about a rookie wide receiver for the Buffalo Bills getting 4+ receptions in a home game against Tampa Bay.\n\nKey factors to consider:\n1.

      "reasoning": "Let me analyze this question about whether Coinbase will announce an acquisition of any company in 2025.\n\nFirst, let me consider Coinbase's historical acquisition activity:\n- Coinbase has been quite active in acquisitions historically. They've made numerous acquisitions over the years, including companies like Neutrino (2019), Bison Trails (2021), FairX (2022), One River Digital (2022), and others.\n- In 2023-2024, acquisition activity in crypto slowed somewhat due to market conditions and regulatory uncertainty.\n\nFactors suggesting YES:\n1. Coinbase has a history of making acquisitions to expand capabilities\n2. The crypto market has been recovering, which could enable more M&A activity\n3. Coinbase has significant cash reserves and could be looking to expand\n4. The question only requires an announcement, not a closed deal - this is a lower bar\n5. With potential regulatory clarity under a new administration in 2025, Coinbase might be more aggressive\n6. Competition in the crypto space often drives consolidation\n7. Coinbase might want to expand into new areas like AI, DeFi, or international markets\n\nFactors suggesting NO:\n1. Regulatory uncertainty could still make acquisitions risky\n2. Economic conditions might not favor M&A\n3. Coinbase might focus on organic growth instead\n4.

They've made numerous acquisitions over the years, including companies like Neutrino (2019), Bison Trails (2021), FairX (2022), One River Digital (2022), and others.\n- In 2023-2024, acquisition activity in crypto slowed somewhat due to market conditions and regulatory uncertainty.\n\nFactors suggesting YES:\n1. Coinbase has a history of making acquisitions to expand capabilities\n2. The crypto market has been recovering, which could enable more M&A activity\n3. Coinbase has significant cash reserves and could be looking to expand\n4. The question only requires an announcement, not a closed deal - this is a lower bar\n5. With potential regulatory clarity under a new administration in 2025, Coinbase might be more aggressive\n6. Competition in the crypto space often drives consolidation\n7. Coinbase might want to expand into new areas like AI, DeFi, or international markets\n\nFactors suggesting NO:\n1. Regulatory uncertainty could still make acquisitions risky\n2. Economic conditions might not favor M&A\n3. Coinbase might focus on organic growth instead\n4. Legal challenges (like SEC lawsuit) might consume resources and attention\n\nBase rate consideration:\n- Looking at Coinbase's history, they've typically made at least 1-2 acquisitions per year during active periods\n- Even in slower years, they've often made smaller acqui-hires or strategic purchases\n- The bar is just \"any company\" and just \"announced\" - this is quite achievable\n\nGiven Coinbase's track record of acquisitions, the improving crypto market conditions, potential regulatory clarity in 2025, and the low bar of just needing an announcement (not a closed deal), I think it's more likely than not that Coinbase will announce at least one acquisition in 2025.\n\nMy estimate: approximately 70-75% chance of yes.\n</think>\n\n<answer>yes</answer>\n<confidence>72</confidence>",

      "reasoning": "This question asks whether Taylor Swift will hold exactly 9 spots in the Billboard Hot 100's top 10 for the week of November 15, 2025.\n\nLet me consider the relevant factors:\n\n1. Historical precedent: Taylor Swift has achieved remarkable chart dominance before. After the release of \"Midnights\" in October 2022, she held all top 10 spots simultaneously - the first artist ever to do so. She's also had significant chart presence with other album releases.\n\n2. For Taylor Swift to hold 9 spots in the top 10, she would need:\n   - A major album release very close to that chart date\n   - The album would need to be extremely successful with streaming and sales\n   - This is an exceptionally rare occurrence - even for Taylor Swift\n\n3. November 15, 2025 timing:\n   - We don't know Taylor Swift's release schedule for late 2025\n   - She could potentially release a new album, re-recorded album (Taylor's Version), or have no major release around that time\n   - Her pattern has been releasing albums in fall (October/November) in recent years\n\n4. Base rates:\n   - Holding 9 spots is extremely rare - it's only happened a handful of times in Billboard history\n   - Even with a major album release, getting exactly 9 (not 8, not 10, but exactly 9) is a very specific outcome\n   - The probability of any artist holding 9 spots in any given week is very low\n\n5. Uncertainty factors:\n   - We don't know if she'll release an album near this date\n   - Even if she does, the exact number of spots is highly variable\n   - Competition from other artists matters\n   - Streaming patterns and first-week sales vary\n\nThe question asks for exactly 9 spots, which is a very specific outcome.

      "raw_output": "<think>\nThis question asks whether Taylor Swift will hold exactly 9 spots in the Billboard Hot 100's top 10 for the week of November 15, 2025.\n\nLet me consider the relevant factors:\n\n1. Historical precedent: Taylor Swift has achieved remarkable chart dominance before. After the release of \"Midnights\" in October 2022, she held all top 10 spots simultaneously - the first artist ever to do so. She's also had significant chart presence with other album releases.\n\n2. For Taylor Swift to hold 9 spots in the top 10, she would need:\n   - A major album release very close to that chart date\n   - The album would need to be extremely successful with streaming and sales\n   - This is an exceptionally rare occurrence - even for Taylor Swift\n\n3. November 15, 2025 timing:\n   - We don't know Taylor Swift's release schedule for late 2025\n   - She could potentially release a new album, re-recorded album (Taylor's Version), or have no major release around that time\n   - Her pattern has been releasing albums in fall (October/November) in recent years\n\n4. Base rates:\n   - Holding 9 spots is extremely rare - it's only happened a handful of times in Billboard history\n   - Even with a major album release, getting exactly 9 (not 8, not 10, but exactly 9) is a very specific outcome\n   - The probability of any artist holding 9 spots in any given week is very low\n\n5. Uncertainty factors:\n   - We don't know if she'll release an album near this date\n   - Even if she does, the exact number of spots is highly variable\n   - Competition from other artists matters\n   - Streaming patterns and first-week sales vary\n\nThe question asks for exactly 9 spots, which is a very specific outcome. Even if Taylor Swift releases a major album around that time, the probability of landing on exactly 9 (rather than 7, 8, or 10) is relatively low. Without confirmed knowledge of a major release scheduled for early November 2025, this seems unlikely.\n</think>\n\n<answer>no</answer>\n<confidence>92</confidence>",

      "reasoning": "Let me think about whether \"Tariff\" will be mentioned during Lyft's next earnings call.\n\nLyft is a ride-sharing company primarily operating in the United States and Canada. Their business model involves connecting riders with drivers through their app.\n\nKey considerations:\n\n1. **Current tariff environment**: As of my knowledge, there have been significant tariff discussions in the US, particularly around trade with China and other countries. The Trump administration implemented various tariffs, and there's ongoing trade policy discussion.\n\n2. **Lyft's business exposure to tariffs**: Lyft is primarily a service company, not a manufacturing or goods-importing company. Their main costs are:\n   - Driver payments\n   - Technology/engineering\n   - Marketing\n   - Corporate overhead\n   - Vehicle costs (for bike/scooter programs)\n\n3. **Potential tariff impacts on Lyft**:\n   - Vehicles: Lyft doesn't own most vehicles (drivers do), but tariffs on auto parts could affect driver costs\n   - Bikes/scooters: Lyft has bike-share programs; many bikes/scooters are manufactured overseas\n   - Technology hardware: Servers, equipment could be affected\n   - General economic impact discussions\n\n4. **Likelihood of mention**: Given that:\n   - Tariffs have been a major economic topic recently (2024-2025)\n   - Analysts often ask about macroeconomic factors\n   - Companies often discuss economic headwinds/tailwinds\n   - However, Lyft is less directly impacted than manufacturing companies\n\n5. **Base rate**: For a service company like Lyft, tariff discussions are less central than for goods companies. However, in the current environment with elevated tariff discussions, it's plausible an analyst might ask about economic impacts or management might mention it in context of consumer spending or costs.\n\n6. **Recent context**: If we're in a period of active tariff policy changes (which has been the case in early 2025), the word is more likely to come up even for companies not directly affected, as they discuss the broader economic environment.\n\nI'd estimate there's a moderate chance (maybe 35-50%) that tariffs get mentioned, either by management discussing economic conditions or by an analyst asking about potential impacts. Service companies mention it less frequently than goods companies, but the current environment makes it more likely than historical base rates would suggest.",

They've made the playoffs consistently and have been AFC East division champions multiple times. In recent seasons (2020-2024), they've typically won 10-13 games per season.\n\n2. **The threshold**: The question asks if they'll win MORE than 5 games, meaning 6 or more wins.

The Bills have not been anywhere close to this level of poor performance in recent years. They've been a playoff contender.\n\n4. **Team stability**: Josh Allen remains their quarterback, and they have maintained a competitive roster. While there's always some roster turnover, there's no indication of a catastrophic decline.\n\n5. **Base rates**: Looking at NFL history, teams that have been consistently good (like the Bills recently) very rarely drop to 5 wins or fewer in a single season without major catastrophic events (key injuries, major roster overhaul, etc.).\n\n6. **Probability assessment**: For a team of the Bills' caliber to win only 5 or fewer games would require an extraordinary collapse. Even with significant injuries or bad luck, playoff-caliber teams almost never fall this far.

      "raw_output": "<think>\nThis question is about the Buffalo Bills' performance in the 2025-26 NFL regular season.\n\nLet me consider the relevant factors:\n\n1. **Recent performance**: The Buffalo Bills have been one of the best teams in the NFL in recent years. They've made the playoffs consistently and have been AFC East division champions multiple times. In recent seasons (2020-2024), they've typically won 10-13 games per season.\n\n2. **The threshold**: The question asks if they'll win MORE than 5 games, meaning 6 or more wins. In a 17-game NFL regular season, this is a relatively low bar - it's essentially asking if they'll be better than one of the worst teams in the league.\n\n3. **Historical context**: Teams that win 5 or fewer games are typically among the bottom 3-5 teams in the NFL. The Bills have not been anywhere close to this level of poor performance in recent years. They've been a playoff contender.\n\n4. **Team stability**: Josh Allen remains their quarterback, and they have maintained a competitive roster. While there's always some roster turnover, there's no indication of a catastrophic decline.\n\n5. **Base rates**: Looking at NFL history, teams that have been consistently good (like the Bills recently) very rarely drop to 5 wins or fewer in a single season without major catastrophic events (key injuries, major roster overhaul, etc.).\n\n6. **Probability assessment**: For a team of the Bills' caliber to win only 5 or fewer games would require an extraordinary collapse. Even with significant injuries or bad luck, playoff-caliber teams almost never fall this far. I'd estimate the probability of the Bills winning MORE than 5 games at around 97-99%.\n\nThe Bills are projected to be a playoff team again, likely winning 10+ games. Winning more than 5 is an extremely low bar for this franchise.\n</think>\n\n<answer>yes</answer>\n<confidence>97</confidence>",

The team has had some success under his leadership, making the playoffs.\n\n2. **Base rates for NBA coaching changes**: NBA coaches get fired fairly regularly, especially if teams underperform. However, coaches with recent success tend to have more job security.\n\n3. **Team performance**: The Pelicans have dealt with significant injury issues (particularly with Zion Williamson), which can create frustration but also provides some excuse for underperformance.\n\n4. **Timeframe**: The question asks about before January 1, 2026. This gives roughly a year or so from late 2024/early 2025. That's enough time for a coaching change to happen if the team struggles.\n\n5. **Recent trends**: I need to consider if there have been any recent reports or indications of instability. Without specific recent news, I'll rely on general NBA patterns.\n\n6. **Typical coaching tenure**: The average NBA head coach tenure is around 2-3 years. Willie Green started in 2021, so by 2026 he would have been coaching for about 4-5 years, which is above average.\n\nGiven that:\n- NBA coaching changes are relatively common\n- The timeframe extends through the end of 2025\n- Teams with injury-plagued rosters sometimes make coaching changes out of frustration\n- But Willie Green has generally been viewed favorably\n\nI'd estimate there's maybe a 30-40% chance of a coaching change before January 1, 2026.

However, for it to be #1 on a chart dated November 13, 2025, it would need to have significant staying power or a re-release/deluxe edition.\n\nActually, I should reconsider - there might be a different album with this title releasing closer to November 2025, or this could be a deluxe/expanded edition release.\n\nLooking at typical chart patterns:\n- Albums typically debut at their peak position and decline over time\n- For an album released in mid-2024 to be #1 in November 2025 would be unusual unless there's a special re-release or deluxe edition\n- New major releases typically dominate the charts\n\nWithout specific information about what's scheduled to release around November 13, 2025, I need to estimate the probability. The chart position depends on:\n1. What other albums are releasing that week\n2. Whether this specific album has enough momentum/sales\n\nGiven that this is asking about a specific album being #1 on a specific date more than a year after its original release, and considering the competitive nature of album charts with constant new releases, the probability seems relatively low unless there's a planned re-release or major event.\n\nThe base rate for any specific album being #1 on a given week is quite low. Even popular albums typically only hold #1 for a few weeks at most.\n\nI'll estimate a relatively low probability for this outcome.\n</think>\n\n<answer>no</answer>\n<confidence>75</confidence>",

Games scoring 95+ are typically considered all-time greats (like The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, Grand Theft Auto IV, etc.).\n\n2.

      "reasoning": "This question asks whether UMass Lowell will beat Wake Forest in a men's college basketball game scheduled for November 16, 2025.\n\nLet me consider the relevant factors:\n\n1. **Conference/Level disparity**: Wake Forest is an ACC (Atlantic Coast Conference) team - one of the \"Power 5\" conferences in college basketball. UMass Lowell competes in the America East Conference, which is a mid-major conference with significantly less resources, recruiting power, and overall talent level.\n\n2. **Historical context**: Power conference teams like Wake Forest typically schedule games against smaller conference teams early in the season (November) as part of their non-conference schedule. These games are usually played at the Power conference team's home court and serve as tune-up games. The Power conference team wins the vast majority of these matchups.\n\n3. **Home court advantage**: This game is at Wake Forest, giving them additional advantage.\n\n4. **Base rates**: When ACC teams host America East teams, the ACC team wins probably 85-95% of the time. While upsets do happen in college basketball, they're relatively rare in these types of matchups, especially at home.\n\n5. **Wake Forest specifically**: Wake Forest has been a middle-to-lower tier ACC team in recent years, but even lower-tier ACC teams are typically significantly better than mid-major teams like UMass Lowell.\n\n6. **UMass Lowell**: They're not typically a powerhouse in the America East and would be significant underdogs in this matchup.\n\nGiven the substantial talent and resource gap between an ACC team playing at home versus an America East team, Wake Forest should be heavily favored. I'd estimate UMass Lowell's chances at roughly 5-10%.",

Looking at recent seasons, draws between these two teams have been relatively common given how evenly matched they are.\n\n2.

However, for matches between top teams that are evenly matched, the draw rate can be somewhat higher.\n\n3.

Thomas Massie is a Republican, so this is a Republican-led effort.\n\n2. **Nature of discharge petitions**: Discharge petitions are rarely successful. They require 218 signatures (a majority of the House) to force a vote on legislation that committee leadership hasn't moved forward.

The fact that a discharge petition is needed suggests leadership opposition. This means getting Republican signatures would be difficult as members typically follow leadership.\n\n4. **Cross-party appeal**: The Epstein files topic has some bipartisan interest, but discharge petitions typically require significant minority party support when the majority party leadership opposes them.\n\n5. **Signature order dynamics**: If the petition were to reach 218 signatures, the question is specifically about whether the 218th signer would be Republican. Given that:\n   - Early signers would likely be the petition sponsor's allies (Republicans)\n   - Democrats might sign to support transparency\n   - The final signatures to reach 218 would likely be the most reluctant signers\n   - If Republicans are reluctant due to leadership pressure, the 218th might more likely be a Democrat who was waiting to see if it would succeed\n\n6. **Probability assessment**: First, the petition reaching 218 signatures at all seems unlikely (maybe 10-15% chance). If it does reach 218, the 218th signer could be either party. Given the dynamics where Republicans face more pressure not to sign from their own leadership, and Democrats might be more willing to pile on once it looks like it will succeed, the 218th signer might slightly favor being a Democrat.\n\nHowever, if Republicans are driving this effort and need to show party unity, they might coordinate to have a Republican be the final signer for political optics.\n\nOverall probability: Low chance of reaching 218 at all, and if it does, maybe 40-50% chance the 218th is Republican.\n\nCombined probability: roughly 5-8% for \"yes\"",

If Biden wins or another Democrat, similar timing applies.\n\nLooking at weekly patterns:\n- There are 52 weeks in a year\n- If a president signs ~40 EOs per year, that's about 40/52 \u2248 0.77 EOs per week on average\n- But many weeks have zero EOs while some weeks have several\n\nThe probability of at least one EO in any given week:\n- If EOs were randomly distributed with an average of ~0.77 per week, using Poisson distribution, P(X\u22651) = 1 - P(X=0) = 1 - e^(-0.77) \u2248 1 - 0.46 \u2248 54%\n\nHowever, this varies significantly:\n- Early in a term, presidents sign many more EOs\n- Some weeks are very active, others quiet\n- October 2025 is not particularly early in a term, so the rate might be closer to average or slightly below\n\nGiven that:\n1. Most weeks do see at least one Executive Order signed\n2. The question asks for \"above 0\" which is a low bar\n3. Historical patterns suggest roughly 50-60% of weeks have at least one EO\n\nI'd estimate the probability at around 55-65% that at least one Executive Order will be signed during this specific week.\n</think>\n\n<answer>yes</answer>\n<confidence>58</confidence>",

The Sun follows an approximately 11-year solar cycle, with periods of solar maximum (high activity) and solar minimum (low activity).\n\nCurrently (as of my knowledge cutoff in early 2025), we are in Solar Cycle 25, which began in December 2019. Solar Cycle 25 has been quite active, and we reached or are near solar maximum around 2024-2025.\n\nX-class flares, while the strongest category, are not extremely rare, especially during solar maximum periods. During active periods, there can be multiple X-class flares per year, sometimes even multiple per month.\n\nLooking at recent history:\n- 2023 had numerous X-class flares\n- 2024 was expected to be near solar maximum and has had significant solar activity\n- The Sun has been particularly active in this cycle\n\nGiven that:\n1. We're at or near solar maximum\n2. X-class flares occur regularly during active periods (typically dozens per year during solar max)\n3. The question asks about ANY X-class flare before December 2025\n4. There's a long time window (the entire year essentially, depending on when this question was created)\n\nThe probability of at least one X-class flare occurring before December 2025 is extremely high. During solar maximum, we typically see X-class flares occurring multiple times per month. In fact, there have already been numerous X-class flares in 2024 and likely in early 2025.\n\nThis is essentially asking whether a relatively common event (during solar maximum) will occur over a substantial time period. The answer is almost certainly yes.\n</think>\n\n<answer>yes</answer>\n<confidence>98</confidence>",

The question is timing. Given nearly a year timeframe and Republican Senate control, confirmation before November 2025 seems likely but not certain.\n\nGiven Republican Senate control and a reasonable timeframe, I'd estimate this has a moderately high probability of resolving \"yes,\" though there's always uncertainty with Senate processes.",

Houston has been a defensive powerhouse under Kelvin Sampson, often playing at slower tempos with excellent defense. Auburn under Bruce Pearl tends to play faster and score more, but can vary year to year.\n\n2. **Historical scoring patterns**: Houston is known for low-scoring games due to their defensive style. They often hold opponents to low scores and don't always score high themselves.

Average college basketball games score around 140-150 points combined, so 152.5 is slightly above average.\n\n4. **Early season game**: November 16 is early in the season. Early season games can be unpredictable - teams are still finding their rhythm, which can lead to either sloppy low-scoring games or high-scoring affairs against mismatched opponents.\n\n5. **Matchup quality**: This appears to be a high-profile early season matchup between two ranked/quality programs. These games often feature tighter defense and more deliberate play.\n\n6. **Houston's tendencies**: Houston's games have historically trended toward unders.

The 152.5 line seems to account for Auburn's potential offensive output, but Houston's defense often suppresses scoring significantly.\n\nMy estimate is that there's roughly a 40-45% chance this goes over 152.5, meaning I lean toward \"no.\"",

Al-Ittihad is historically one of the strongest clubs in Saudi Arabia, while Al-Ahli has also been competitive, especially with recent investments in the Saudi league.\n\n2. **Draw rates in football**: In most top football leagues, draws typically occur in about 20-30% of matches.

Home teams generally have an advantage, which might reduce draw probability slightly.\n\n4. **Match significance**: This is a league match between two strong teams. When two evenly-matched top teams play, draws can be slightly more common, but these are also high-stakes matches where teams push for wins.\n\n5. **Base rates**: Looking at typical football statistics:\n   - Home wins: ~45%\n   - Away wins: ~25-30%\n   - Draws: ~25-30%\n\n6. **Both teams' quality**: Both Al-Ittihad and Al-Ahli are strong teams with significant investments (including high-profile international players in recent years).

Al-Ittihad is historically one of the strongest clubs in Saudi Arabia, while Al-Ahli has also been competitive, especially with recent investments in the Saudi league.\n\n2. **Draw rates in football**: In most top football leagues, draws typically occur in about 20-30% of matches. The Saudi Pro League likely has similar statistics.\n\n3. **Home advantage**: Al-Ittihad appears to be the home team based on the ordering. Home teams generally have an advantage, which might reduce draw probability slightly.\n\n4. **Match significance**: This is a league match between two strong teams. When two evenly-matched top teams play, draws can be slightly more common, but these are also high-stakes matches where teams push for wins.\n\n5. **Base rates**: Looking at typical football statistics:\n   - Home wins: ~45%\n   - Away wins: ~25-30%\n   - Draws: ~25-30%\n\n6. **Both teams' quality**: Both Al-Ittihad and Al-Ahli are strong teams with significant investments (including high-profile international players in recent years).

Looking at his career, he hits this mark maybe 15-25% of games in a good season.\n\n2. **Game script considerations**: \n- Buffalo has a strong offense led by Josh Allen, which could lead to Tampa Bay playing from behind and needing to pass more\n- This could increase Mayfield's passing volume\n- However, Buffalo also has a solid defense\n\n3. **Buffalo's pass defense**: Buffalo typically has a competent defense, though not elite against the pass. This is a neutral to slightly negative factor.\n\n4. **Weather**: November in Buffalo could mean cold/windy conditions, which typically suppresses passing numbers.\n\n5. **Tampa Bay's offensive style**: Under their current system, they have capable receivers (Mike Evans, Chris Godwin if healthy) which gives Mayfield weapons to hit big numbers.\n\n6. **Historical context**: Looking at high passing yard games, 325+ is roughly the 75th-80th percentile for a starting QB's performance. Most QBs hit this mark only a handful of times per season.\n\nBase rate estimation: For a QB of Mayfield's caliber, hitting 325+ yards probably happens in roughly 15-25% of games.

Let me consider relevant factors:\n\n1. **White's rushing profile**: White has been Tampa Bay's lead back, though he's known more as a versatile back who contributes in the passing game. His rushing yards per game have varied, and he's not always a high-volume rusher.\n\n2. **Historical rushing stats**: In the 2023 season, White averaged around 50-55 rushing yards per game. His rushing totals can be inconsistent - some games he gets 70-80+ yards, others he's under 40 yards.\n\n3. **Buffalo's run defense**: The Bills typically have a solid defense, though their run defense quality can vary year to year. They're generally a well-coached team that prepares well against opponents.\n\n4. **Game script considerations**: If Tampa Bay falls behind against Buffalo (who have been a strong team with Josh Allen), they may need to pass more, limiting White's rushing opportunities.\n\n5. **60-yard threshold**: This is a moderate threshold for a starting RB. Looking at typical RB performances, getting 60+ yards happens maybe 40-50% of the time for a feature back, depending on the matchup and game flow.\n\n6. **Buccaneers' offensive style**: Tampa Bay under recent coaching has been more pass-heavy, which could limit White's rushing attempts.\n\nGiven White's inconsistent rushing totals (often in the 40-70 yard range), Buffalo's typically solid defense, and potential negative game script, I'd estimate this is roughly a coin flip with a slight lean toward \"no.\"\n\nMy estimate: approximately 40-45% chance of 60+ rushing yards.",

It depends heavily on what they're promoting and the direction of the conversation.\n\n7. Without knowing the specific date of this appearance or what Sydney Sweeney is promoting at the time, I have to estimate based on general patterns.\n\nGiven that TikTok is ubiquitous in pop culture discussions and Sydney Sweeney is a young, social media-savvy celebrity, there's a reasonable chance it comes up, but it's far from certain.\n</think>\n\n<answer>yes</answer>\n<confidence>42</confidence>",

The political dynamics between Congress and the White House significantly impact what type of bill passes.\n\n2. **Historical patterns**: Clean CRs are relatively common as short-term stopgap measures when Congress can't agree on full appropriations or when there are political disagreements. However, they're often not the preferred solution - parties typically try to attach policy riders or spending changes.\n\n3. **Definition specifics**: The question defines a clean CR quite strictly - no additional policy provisions, earmarks, or modifications.

Trump's handshake history: Trump is known for his distinctive, often prolonged handshakes. He has been observed engaging in lengthy, firm handshakes with world leaders, sometimes pulling them toward him or holding on for extended periods. This has been a notable characteristic of his diplomatic interactions.\n\n2. Trump-Netanyahu relationship: Trump and Netanyahu have historically had a warm relationship. Trump moved the US embassy to Jerusalem, recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, and generally supported Netanyahu's policies. Given this friendly relationship, a longer, more demonstrative handshake would be expected.\n\n3. Context of the meeting: If this is referring to a meeting during Trump's second term (post-January 2025), the context matters. Given ongoing events in the Middle East and the close US-Israel relationship under Trump, there would likely be a warm, extended greeting.\n\n4. Typical handshake duration: A normal handshake lasts about 2-5 seconds. An 8-second handshake is notably long - it's the kind of extended handshake that makes news and is often seen in photo opportunities between close allies.\n\n5. Trump's tendency for theatrical gestures: Trump often uses handshakes as a display of dominance or friendship, and 8 seconds is within the range of his longer handshakes with allies.\n\nGiven Trump's history of extended handshakes and his warm relationship with Netanyahu, I think there's a reasonable chance their handshake would last at least 8 seconds, especially in a formal meeting setting with cameras present.

National political environment: The 2025 election will occur after the 2024 presidential election, which could affect turnout and enthusiasm\n3. Jay Jones would need to first win the Democratic primary, then the general election\n4. Incumbent advantage for Miyares if he runs for re-election\n\nThe question asks specifically about Jay Jones winning. This requires:\n1. Jones running and winning the Democratic primary\n2. Jones winning the general election against the Republican nominee\n\nAs of my knowledge cutoff, I don't have confirmed information about whether Jay Jones is definitely running in 2025 or the full field of candidates. Virginia AG races can be competitive.\n\nGiven:\n- Virginia is a swing state that has leaned Democratic recently but Republicans won in 2021\n- Incumbents generally have advantages\n- The specific candidate (Jay Jones) adds uncertainty about primary success\n- Political environment is uncertain\n\nI'd estimate this is roughly a toss-up race for Democrats vs Republicans, and then there's additional uncertainty about whether Jones specifically would be the Democratic nominee. Overall, I'd put the probability of Jay Jones specifically winning at around 30-40%.\n</think>\n\n<answer>no</answer>\n<confidence>62</confidence>",

It's been operational for some time but the \"MET\" token launch appears to be a new token launch event.\n\n2. **FDV threshold**: $9 billion is a very high FDV, especially for a newly launched token. This would place it among the top cryptocurrencies by FDV.\n\n3. **Historical context for new token launches**: \n   - Most new token launches, even from established projects, don't reach $9B FDV immediately\n   - However, some high-profile launches during bull markets have achieved very high valuations quickly\n   - Solana ecosystem tokens have seen significant interest\n\n4. **Base rates**: Looking at recent token launches:\n   - Very few tokens launch with FDV above $9B\n   - Even successful DeFi protocols typically have FDVs in the hundreds of millions to low billions\n   - Reaching $9B FDV 1 day after launch would be exceptional\n\n5. **Market conditions**: Without knowing the exact launch date and current market conditions, this is harder to assess.

The wording is a bit ambiguous - it says \"Above/below\" which could mean either direction. However, given the title \"How low will Ethereum get this year?\" this seems to be asking if ETH will drop below $3,250.\n\nLet me consider the current context:\n- As of my knowledge cutoff and typical market conditions, Ethereum has been trading in various ranges\n- In 2024-2025, ETH has seen significant volatility\n- Current ETH prices (as of early 2025) have been in the $2,000-$4,000 range depending on the time period\n\nKey factors to consider:\n1. Crypto market volatility - Ethereum regularly sees 20-50% swings within a year\n2. Macroeconomic conditions - interest rates, inflation, regulatory environment\n3. Ethereum-specific factors - network upgrades, staking yields, DeFi activity\n4. Bitcoin correlation - ETH often follows BTC trends\n5. The question asks about the price at a specific point (Dec 31, 2025 at 10:00 AM ET)\n\nGiven the ambiguous \"Above/below\" phrasing, I need to interpret this. If it resolves to \"Yes\" when ETH is either above OR below 3250, that would always be true (it has to be one or the other). So this must mean the market is asking if ETH will be BELOW $3,250.\n\nLooking at historical patterns:\n- ETH has shown it can easily trade below $3,250 during bearish periods\n- It has also traded well above $3,250 during bullish periods\n- The crypto market is notoriously difficult to predict\n\nFor a December 31, 2025 resolution:\n- There's substantial time for market movements\n- Crypto markets could be in various phases by then\n- The $3,250 level is roughly in the middle of recent trading ranges\n\nGiven the uncertainty and the fact that ETH could reasonably be either above or below this level, I'd estimate roughly 45-55% probability either way. Given recent bullish sentiment around crypto and potential ETF flows, ETH might be slightly more likely to be above $3,250 by year end, making \"below $3,250\" slightly less likely.\n\nI'll estimate about 45% chance ETH is below $3,250 by Dec 31, 2025.",

Given that:\n   - Tariffs are a hot topic in current economic discourse\n   - Griffin frequently comments on economic policy\n   - Business forums typically cover trade and economic policy\n   - The threshold is just saying the word once (including plural \"tariffs\")\n\nThe probability that Ken Griffin would mention \"tariff\" or \"tariffs\" at least once during a business forum appearance seems quite high. Business leaders at such events almost inevitably discuss trade policy, supply chains, inflation impacts, and related topics where tariffs come up naturally.\n\nI would estimate there's a high likelihood (around 80-90%) that he would say the word at least once during such an appearance.\n</think>\n\n<answer>yes</answer>\n<confidence>82</confidence>",

      "reasoning": "This question asks whether Taylor Swift's \"The Fate of Ophelia\" will be #1 on Spotify Daily Top Songs USA for 8 consecutive days starting October 3, 2025.\n\nLet me consider the relevant factors:\n\n1. Taylor Swift's track record: Taylor Swift is one of the biggest artists on Spotify, and her new releases typically debut at #1 and often stay there for multiple days. However, 8 consecutive days is a significant stretch.\n\n2. Historical context: Looking at past Taylor Swift releases, songs from her albums often debut strong but face competition from other major releases. The longevity at #1 varies considerably.\n\n3. \"The Fate of Ophelia\" context: This appears to be a track that would be released around late 2025. If it's a lead single or from a highly anticipated album, it would have stronger staying power.\n\n4. Competition: The Spotify Daily charts are highly competitive, and maintaining #1 for 8 straight days requires not just a strong debut but sustained streaming momentum without major competing releases.\n\n5. Base rates: Even for major artists like Taylor Swift, holding #1 for 8+ consecutive days is not guaranteed. Many hit songs peak for 2-5 days before being displaced. However, Taylor Swift's dedicated fanbase often provides sustained streaming support.\n\n6.

      "raw_output": "<think>\nThis question asks whether Taylor Swift's \"The Fate of Ophelia\" will be #1 on Spotify Daily Top Songs USA for 8 consecutive days starting October 3, 2025.\n\nLet me consider the relevant factors:\n\n1. Taylor Swift's track record: Taylor Swift is one of the biggest artists on Spotify, and her new releases typically debut at #1 and often stay there for multiple days. However, 8 consecutive days is a significant stretch.\n\n2. Historical context: Looking at past Taylor Swift releases, songs from her albums often debut strong but face competition from other major releases. The longevity at #1 varies considerably.\n\n3. \"The Fate of Ophelia\" context: This appears to be a track that would be released around late 2025. If it's a lead single or from a highly anticipated album, it would have stronger staying power.\n\n4. Competition: The Spotify Daily charts are highly competitive, and maintaining #1 for 8 straight days requires not just a strong debut but sustained streaming momentum without major competing releases.\n\n5. Base rates: Even for major artists like Taylor Swift, holding #1 for 8+ consecutive days is not guaranteed. Many hit songs peak for 2-5 days before being displaced. However, Taylor Swift's dedicated fanbase often provides sustained streaming support.\n\n6.

This gives only a 2-hour window for the AP to make a call before the 9:00 PM deadline.\n\n2. **Historical patterns for Virginia statewide races**: Virginia has become increasingly efficient at counting votes due to expanded early voting and mail-in voting. In recent elections, results have come in relatively quickly.\n\n3. **Attorney General race competitiveness**: The AG race is typically less high-profile than the gubernatorial race, but its competitiveness matters. If it's a blowout, AP could call it quickly.

Songs from TTPD have been performing very well, though streaming numbers vary significantly by track.\n\n2. **Time frame**: From the album release (April 2024) to November 7, 2025 is approximately 18-19 months.\n\n3. **Track popularity**: \"The Fate of Ophelia\" is not one of the lead singles or most popular tracks from TTPD. The bigger hits from the album include \"Fortnight,\" \"I Can Do It With a Broken Heart,\" and others. Deep cuts and non-single tracks typically accumulate streams much more slowly.\n\n4. **395 million streams threshold**: This is a significant number.

Based on typical streaming patterns for deep cuts from major albums, reaching 395 million streams in this timeframe would require the song to be performing exceptionally well.\n\nGiven that this is Taylor Swift and her fanbase is extremely dedicated, but this isn't a lead single, I'd estimate this is somewhat uncertain but leaning toward possible given her streaming power.",

Timeline: October 1, 2025 is relatively soon - IPO processes typically take 6-12 months from decision to completion\n2. OpenAI's corporate structure is complex - they would need to resolve their unusual governance structure first\n3. The AI industry is hot, which could accelerate IPO timelines\n4. OpenAI has been raising significant private funding (reportedly at $150B+ valuations), which might reduce immediate IPO pressure\n5. Recent reports suggest OpenAI is working on restructuring to a for-profit entity, but this is a prerequisite step, not the IPO itself\n\nThe resolution criteria are relatively broad - just needing SEC Form S-1 effectiveness, pricing, or ticker assignment. But even with these criteria, the timeline is tight.\n\nRecent news (late 2024/early 2025) suggests OpenAI is moving toward for-profit conversion with potential IPO plans, but most reports suggest this would happen over a 2-year timeline, not within months.\n\nBase rate: Major tech IPOs typically have some lead time and public speculation. Given the complexity of OpenAI's structure and the typical IPO timeline, an IPO confirmation by October 2025 seems unlikely but not impossible.\n\nMy assessment: While OpenAI is clearly moving in the direction of eventually going public, the specific timeline of before October 1, 2025 seems too aggressive given the structural changes needed and typical IPO timelines. I'd estimate roughly 20-30% chance.",
      "raw_output": "<think>\nLet me consider the key factors for whether OpenAI will confirm an IPO before October 1, 2025.\n\nCurrent situation (as of my knowledge):\n- OpenAI has been primarily a private company, initially as a non-profit and then transitioning to a \"capped-profit\" structure\n- There have been reports about OpenAI considering restructuring to become a for-profit company\n- Sam Altman has historically indicated OpenAI wasn't planning an IPO in the near term\n- However, in late 2024/early 2025, there were increasing reports about OpenAI potentially converting to a for-profit structure, which could be a precursor to an IPO\n\nKey considerations:\n1. Timeline: October 1, 2025 is relatively soon - IPO processes typically take 6-12 months from decision to completion\n2. OpenAI's corporate structure is complex - they would need to resolve their unusual governance structure first\n3. The AI industry is hot, which could accelerate IPO timelines\n4. OpenAI has been raising significant private funding (reportedly at $150B+ valuations), which might reduce immediate IPO pressure\n5. Recent reports suggest OpenAI is working on restructuring to a for-profit entity, but this is a prerequisite step, not the IPO itself\n\nThe resolution criteria are relatively broad - just needing SEC Form S-1 effectiveness, pricing, or ticker assignment. But even with these criteria, the timeline is tight.\n\nRecent news (late 2024/early 2025) suggests OpenAI is moving toward for-profit conversion with potential IPO plans, but most reports suggest this would happen over a 2-year timeline, not within months.\n\nBase rate: Major tech IPOs typically have some lead time and public speculation. Given the complexity of OpenAI's structure and the typical IPO timeline, an IPO confirmation by October 2025 seems unlikely but not impossible.\n\nMy assessment: While OpenAI is clearly moving in the direction of eventually going public, the specific timeline of before October 1, 2025 seems too aggressive given the structural changes needed and typical IPO timelines. I'd estimate roughly 20-30% chance.\n</think>\n\n<answer>no</answer>\n<confidence>72</confidence>",

This is an unusual situation - typically military pay comes from government appropriations.\n\n2. **Timeline**: The question asks about naming before November 1, 2025. I need to assess how likely it is that donor names would become public within this timeframe.\n\n3. **Factors favoring \"yes\" (name revealed)**:\n- Media and public interest in such a large donation would be intense\n- Congressional oversight might demand transparency\n- FOIA requests could be filed\n- Investigative journalism often uncovers such information\n- Some donors might want public recognition\n- The unusual nature of private funding for military pay would attract scrutiny\n\n4. **Factors favoring \"no\" (name not revealed)**:\n- Donors may have requested anonymity\n- DoD might protect donor privacy\n- Legal restrictions might prevent disclosure\n- The donation might have been structured to maintain anonymity\n- Government agencies can be slow to release information\n\n5. **Base rates**: Large anonymous donations to government functions are relatively rare, and when they occur, there's often significant pressure to reveal the source. However, the government can be protective of donor information.\n\n6. **Current date consideration**: If we're in late 2024 or early 2025, and this involves a 2025 shutdown, there's substantial time for the information to emerge through various channels (leaks, investigations, journalism).\n\nGiven the extraordinary nature of a $130M private donation to cover military pay, the intense public interest this would generate, and the likelihood of congressional and journalistic investigation, I think there's a moderate-to-good chance the donor's name would emerge before November 2025. However, there's also significant uncertainty given potential privacy protections.\n\nThe description mentions \"including reports relying on anonymous/unnamed sources\" which lowers the bar - even a leak to journalists that names the donor would count.",

I need to assess how likely it is that donor names would become public within this timeframe.\n\n3. **Factors favoring \"yes\" (name revealed)**:\n- Media and public interest in such a large donation would be intense\n- Congressional oversight might demand transparency\n- FOIA requests could be filed\n- Investigative journalism often uncovers such information\n- Some donors might want public recognition\n- The unusual nature of private funding for military pay would attract scrutiny\n\n4. **Factors favoring \"no\" (name not revealed)**:\n- Donors may have requested anonymity\n- DoD might protect donor privacy\n- Legal restrictions might prevent disclosure\n- The donation might have been structured to maintain anonymity\n- Government agencies can be slow to release information\n\n5. **Base rates**: Large anonymous donations to government functions are relatively rare, and when they occur, there's often significant pressure to reveal the source. However, the government can be protective of donor information.\n\n6. **Current date consideration**: If we're in late 2024 or early 2025, and this involves a 2025 shutdown, there's substantial time for the information to emerge through various channels (leaks, investigations, journalism).\n\nGiven the extraordinary nature of a $130M private donation to cover military pay, the intense public interest this would generate, and the likelihood of congressional and journalistic investigation, I think there's a moderate-to-good chance the donor's name would emerge before November 2025. However, there's also significant uncertainty given potential privacy protections.\n\nThe description mentions \"including reports relying on anonymous/unnamed sources\" which lowers the bar - even a leak to journalists that names the donor would count.\n</think>\n\n<answer>yes</answer>\n<confidence>62</confidence>",

The question asks whether her next press briefing will be 65 minutes or longer.\n\nKey factors to consider:\n\n1. **Typical press briefing length**: White House press briefings typically range from about 20-45 minutes on average. 65 minutes would be on the longer end but not unprecedented.\n\n2. **Recent patterns**: Trump administration press briefings have historically varied in length. Some briefings, especially those with guest speakers or during major news events, can run longer.\n\n3. **The measurement criteria**: The time includes pauses and any guest speakers if Leavitt returns as primary speaker afterward. This is important because briefings with cabinet members or other officials as guests tend to run longer.\n\n4. **Base rate consideration**: Looking at typical press briefing lengths, most fall under 65 minutes. A 65+ minute briefing would likely require either:\n   - A major news event requiring extended Q&A\n   - Guest speakers participating\n   - Particularly contentious questioning\n\n5. **Uncertainty factors**: \n   - We don't know when the \"next\" briefing is or what news cycle it will fall in\n   - The Trump administration has shown varied briefing patterns\n   - Guest speakers could extend the time significantly\n\nGiven that 65 minutes is above the typical briefing length, and most briefings don't reach this threshold, I'd estimate the probability is below 50%. However, the inclusion of guest speaker time in the measurement does increase the chances somewhat.\n\nBased on historical patterns of press briefings, I'd estimate roughly 25-35% chance of the briefing lasting 65+ minutes.",

However, upsets do happen in esports, and the gap between teams can narrow.\n\nI'll estimate Team Falcons has roughly a 35-40% chance of winning this match based on historical team strength differentials.\n</think>\n\n<answer>no</answer>\n<confidence>38</confidence>",

Songs like \"Monster Mash\" have also charted but typically not in the Top 10.\n\nI'd estimate there's maybe a 15-25% chance of this happening.

      "reasoning": "To predict whether the Nasdaq-100 will be below 23700 at the end of November 14, 2025, I need to consider:\n\n1. Current Nasdaq-100 level: As of my knowledge cutoff, I need to estimate where the Nasdaq-100 is trading. In late 2024/early 2025, the Nasdaq-100 was trading in the range of roughly 19,000-21,500. However, I should note my knowledge has limitations on the most recent data.\n\n2. Historical growth rates: The Nasdaq-100 has historically grown at varying rates. In bull markets, it can gain 20-30%+ annually, while in bear markets it can decline significantly.\n\n3. Time horizon: November 14, 2025 is the target date. From early 2025, that's roughly 9-10 months away.\n\n4. The threshold of 23,700: This represents a significant level. If the Nasdaq-100 is currently around 20,000-21,000, reaching 23,700 would require roughly 13-18% growth, which is achievable but not guaranteed in a ~10 month period.\n\n5. Market conditions: Various factors could influence this - Fed policy, economic growth, tech sector performance, geopolitical events, AI/tech developments, etc.\n\n6. Volatility consideration: Markets can be volatile, and even if the index trends toward or above 23,700, it could be below on any specific day.\n\nLet me think about this more carefully. If I assume the Nasdaq-100 is around 20,500 currently (a rough estimate for early 2025), then 23,700 represents about a 15.6% increase. \n\nGiven:\n- The Nasdaq-100's historical tendency to grow over time\n- The current AI/tech bull market momentum\n- But also considering potential corrections, rate policy uncertainty, and economic risks\n\nThe question asks if it will be BELOW 23,700. If there's reasonable probability the index reaches or exceeds 23,700 by November 2025, then the answer would be \"no.\" If it's more likely to remain below that level, the answer is \"yes.\"\n\nGiven typical market growth rates and the relatively high threshold, I'd estimate there's perhaps a 45-55% chance the Nasdaq-100 stays below 23,700 by that date. This is quite uncertain given the many variables involved.\n\nActually, I should reconsider - if the Nasdaq-100 has been performing strongly in 2024-2025 with AI momentum, it might already be closer to this level or even above it. Without precise current data, this is challenging. I'll lean slightly toward \"yes\" (below 23,700) given the uncertainty and the fact that reaching such levels requires sustained bullish momentum.",

If I assume the Nasdaq-100 is around 20,500 currently (a rough estimate for early 2025), then 23,700 represents about a 15.6% increase. \n\nGiven:\n- The Nasdaq-100's historical tendency to grow over time\n- The current AI/tech bull market momentum\n- But also considering potential corrections, rate policy uncertainty, and economic risks\n\nThe question asks if it will be BELOW 23,700. If there's reasonable probability the index reaches or exceeds 23,700 by November 2025, then the answer would be \"no.\" If it's more likely to remain below that level, the answer is \"yes.\"\n\nGiven typical market growth rates and the relatively high threshold, I'd estimate there's perhaps a 45-55% chance the Nasdaq-100 stays below 23,700 by that date. This is quite uncertain given the many variables involved.\n\nActually, I should reconsider - if the Nasdaq-100 has been performing strongly in 2024-2025 with AI momentum, it might already be closer to this level or even above it. Without precise current data, this is challenging. I'll lean slightly toward \"yes\" (below 23,700) given the uncertainty and the fact that reaching such levels requires sustained bullish momentum.\n</think>\n\n<answer>yes</answer>\n<confidence>52</confidence>",

Let me consider his typical performance:\n\n1. **Historical rushing performance**: In the 2023 season, White averaged around 50-60 rushing yards per game. In 2024, his usage has been similar. He's a capable back but not typically a high-volume rusher, as Tampa Bay often relies on their passing game.\n\n2. **70+ rushing yards threshold**: This is a moderately high bar for White. Looking at his game logs, he reaches 70+ rushing yards in roughly 25-35% of his games, depending on the season and matchup.\n\n3. **Matchup considerations**: Buffalo typically has a solid run defense, though this can vary year to year. Playing at Buffalo in mid-November could mean cold weather, which sometimes favors the run game but also can be challenging for visiting teams.\n\n4. **Game script factors**: If Tampa Bay falls behind against Buffalo (a strong team), they may abandon the run, limiting White's opportunities. However, if it's competitive or Tampa leads, White could see more carries.\n\n5. **Base rate analysis**: For a running back of White's caliber, hitting 70+ yards happens maybe 30-35% of the time in a typical game. Against a decent defense on the road, this might be slightly lower.\n\n6. **Uncertainty**: This game is in November 2025, so roster changes, injuries, and team dynamics could shift significantly.\n\nGiven White's typical production and the moderately difficult threshold of 70 yards against what projects to be a solid Buffalo defense, I'd estimate the probability at around 30-35%.",

Democrats typically support continuing resolutions and omnibus spending bills, especially when they're negotiated with bipartisan support or when the alternative is a government shutdown.\n\n2. **Historical patterns on spending bills**: Omnibus bills, minibuses, and CRs typically pass with broad bipartisan support because the alternative (government shutdown) is politically costly for both parties.

Schedule considerations: Even AAC teams face challenges - road games, rivalry games, and the general unpredictability of college football make undefeated seasons extremely difficult.\n\nThe probability of North Texas going undefeated is very low - I'd estimate somewhere around 1-3% at most, and that might even be generous given their recent performance levels.\n</think>\n\n<answer>no</answer>\n<confidence>97</confidence>",

It has typically traded in the $0.05-$0.15 range for much of 2023-2024.\n\n2. **The threshold**: $0.255 is a relatively moderate price for Dogecoin - not at its highs but above typical trading ranges in recent years.\n\n3. **Factors that could push DOGE higher**:\n   - General crypto bull market cycles (Bitcoin halving occurred in April 2024, which historically precedes bull runs)\n   - Elon Musk's continued association with Dogecoin\n   - Increased adoption or use cases\n   - Overall market sentiment improvement\n\n4. **Factors that could keep DOGE lower**:\n   - Regulatory pressures on crypto\n   - Lack of fundamental utility compared to other cryptocurrencies\n   - General market downturns\n   - Competition from other meme coins\n\n5. **Historical patterns**: Dogecoin tends to spike during crypto bull markets and when there's social media hype, particularly from Elon Musk. The 2024-2025 period could see a bull market following the Bitcoin halving.\n\n6. **Base rate consideration**: Looking at Dogecoin's price history, it has spent relatively limited time above $0.25.

      "reasoning": "Let me analyze this question about Ahri being picked in the LCK Finals 2025.\n\nFirst, some context about Ahri in professional League of Legends:\n- Ahri is a mid-lane mage/assassin champion that has historically been a popular pick in professional play\n- She's been in and out of the meta over the years, often seeing play when her kit is strong or when the meta favors mobile mages\n- Ahri received significant changes in recent seasons that have affected her viability\n\nFor the 2025 LCK Finals specifically:\n- The LCK (League of Legends Champions Korea) Finals is typically a best-of-5 series\n- This means there are up to 5 games where Ahri could potentially be picked\n- The question asks if she's picked \"at any time\" during the finals, which is a relatively low bar to clear\n\nKey considerations:\n1. Meta dependency: Whether Ahri is picked depends heavily on the current meta at the time of the finals\n2. Historical pick rates: Ahri has been a reasonably popular champion in pro play when viable\n3. Korean teams tend to follow meta picks closely but also have their own preferences\n4. The LCK Finals typically feature top-tier teams with diverse champion pools\n\nLooking at recent professional play trends:\n- In 2024 and early 2025, Ahri has seen varying levels of play depending on patch changes\n- She's generally considered a safe, versatile mid-lane pick when in a reasonable state\n- Korean mid-laners historically have shown proficiency on Ahri\n\nThe probability question: In a best-of-5 series with potentially 10 different champion picks per game (5 per team), and considering Ahri's historical presence in pro play, there's a reasonable chance she gets picked at least once if she's anywhere near meta-viable.\n\nHowever, if she's significantly out of meta or has been nerfed, she might not see any play. The LCK Finals is a high-stakes match where teams typically stick to proven, strong picks.\n\nGiven that Ahri is a historically popular champion and the question only requires one pick across an entire series, I'd estimate there's a moderate-to-good chance she gets picked, but it's not guaranteed.",

They went public in early 2025 and are a major player in the AI infrastructure space.\n\nThe question is whether the word \"Tariff\" will be mentioned during their next earnings call.\n\nKey considerations:\n\n1. CoreWeave's business model: They provide cloud GPU computing services, primarily for AI workloads. Their main costs involve acquiring GPUs (primarily from NVIDIA) and building/operating data centers.\n\n2. Tariff relevance to CoreWeave:\n- GPUs and data center equipment are largely manufactured overseas (particularly in Asia)\n- The current trade environment (2025) has significant tariff discussions, especially US-China tensions\n- NVIDIA chips and other semiconductor equipment could be affected by tariffs\n- Data center construction materials might also be impacted\n\n3. Current economic/political context: As of 2025, tariffs have been a major topic in US trade policy, particularly around technology and semiconductors. Companies in the tech/AI space have been discussing supply chain impacts.\n\n4. Earnings call content typically covers:\n- Financial results\n- Business outlook\n- Risks and challenges\n- Supply chain considerations\n- Cost structures\n\n5. Base rate consideration: Many tech companies, especially those dependent on hardware supply chains, have been mentioning tariffs in their earnings calls during periods of trade uncertainty. Given the current environment and CoreWeave's dependence on GPU hardware (often manufactured or assembled in Asia), tariffs could impact their costs and supply chain.\n\n6.

Their main costs involve acquiring GPUs (primarily from NVIDIA) and building/operating data centers.\n\n2. Tariff relevance to CoreWeave:\n- GPUs and data center equipment are largely manufactured overseas (particularly in Asia)\n- The current trade environment (2025) has significant tariff discussions, especially US-China tensions\n- NVIDIA chips and other semiconductor equipment could be affected by tariffs\n- Data center construction materials might also be impacted\n\n3. Current economic/political context: As of 2025, tariffs have been a major topic in US trade policy, particularly around technology and semiconductors. Companies in the tech/AI space have been discussing supply chain impacts.\n\n4.

      "reasoning": "Let me analyze this question about Hurricane Melissa becoming a Category 4 hurricane.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what we know:\n1. This is asking about a hurricane named \"Melissa\" reaching Category 4 status (\u2265130 mph sustained winds)\n2. The resolution deadline is December 1, 2025\n\nKey factors to consider:\n\n1. **Hurricane naming**: The name \"Melissa\" is on the Atlantic hurricane naming list. It would be used for the 13th named storm of the season (M is the 13th letter used in Atlantic naming).\n\n2. **Timing**: For Melissa to form, there would need to be 12 named storms before it. The Atlantic hurricane season runs June 1 - November 30, with peak activity in August-September.\n\n3. **Historical base rates**: \n   - Not all named storms become hurricanes\n   - Of those that become hurricanes, only a fraction reach Category 4+\n   - Historically, about 20-25% of Atlantic hurricanes reach major hurricane status (Cat 3+)\n   - Category 4+ is even rarer - perhaps 10-15% of all hurricanes\n\n4. **Getting to \"M\" storm**: In an average season, the Atlantic sees about 14 named storms. Getting to the 13th named storm (Melissa) happens in moderately active to active seasons.\n\n5. **Late-season storms**: If Melissa forms, it would likely be later in the season (September-November), when sea surface temperatures may still support intensification but wind shear can increase.\n\n6. **Conditional probability**: \n   - P(Melissa forms) - depends on season activity, maybe 50-60% in a typical year\n   - P(Melissa becomes a hurricane | Melissa forms) - roughly 50%\n   - P(Melissa reaches Cat 4 | Melissa is a hurricane) - roughly 15-20%\n\nCombined probability: roughly 0.55 \u00d7 0.5 \u00d7 0.175 \u2248 4-5%\n\nHowever, I should note that I don't have current information about the 2025 hurricane season status. If we're already in the season and there's already a storm named Melissa, that would change the analysis significantly.\n\nGiven the base rates and the relatively low probability of any specific named storm reaching Category 4 status, I would estimate this has a low probability of resolving \"yes.\"",
