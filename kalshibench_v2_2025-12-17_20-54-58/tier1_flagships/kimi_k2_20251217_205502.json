While the podcast has featured political figures, Trump appearing would depend on several low-probability factors converging.\n\n**Key considerations:**\n- **2025 context**: If Trump wins the 2024 election, he'd be a sitting president in 2025\u2014presidents almost never appear on niche podcasts, making this extremely unlikely (base rate near zero). If he loses, he'd be a former president with more flexibility, but still faces significant barriers.\n- **Host dynamics**: David Sacks has supported Trump and could advocate for this, but other hosts (particularly Chamath and Calacanis) have been critical, creating internal friction.\n- **Strategic value**: Trump might see value in reaching the podcast's affluent, tech-savvy donor base, but his team likely prioritizes larger platforms with bigger reach.\n- **Logistical barriers**: Trump's schedule, security requirements, and the podcast's format (long-form, informal conversation) create mismatches.\n- **Base rates**: High-profile politicians rarely appear on this specific podcast. When they do, they're typically tech-policy specialists (Yang, Khanna) rather than former presidents.\n\n**Probability assessment**: The confluence of necessary conditions (Trump's availability, host agreement, strategic alignment, logistics) is unlikely. Even with the Sacks connection, the probability sits around 10-15%. The most likely path is a post-election 2024 scenario where Trump is building influence, but the podcast would need to actively pursue and secure a commitment.\n\n<answer>no</answer>\n<confidence>12</confidence>",

      "raw_output": "Based on the matchup between Shkendija Tetovo (North Macedonia) and Jagiellonia Bialystok (Poland) in the UEFA Conference League, several factors point toward the Polish side being favored despite Shkendija's home advantage.\n\nJagiellonia Bialystok competes in the Polish Ekstraklasa, which has a significantly higher UEFA coefficient ranking (typically 15-20th) compared to the Macedonian First League (typically 30-40th). Polish clubs generally have superior resources, squad depth, and European experience compared to Macedonian counterparts. Historically, in UEFA competitions, teams from top-20 ranked leagues win approximately 60-65% of matches against teams from leagues ranked below 30th, even when playing away.\n\nWhile Shkendija Tetovo will benefit from home advantage (worth roughly 0.3-0.5 goals in soccer), this typically only improves their win probability by 10-15 percentage points in such mismatches. The match being in November 2025 introduces substantial uncertainty regarding current form, roster changes, and managerial situations, but the structural quality gap between the leagues is likely to persist.\n\nConsidering these factors, the base rate probability for a Shkendija Tetovo victory appears to be in the 20-30% range.

      "raw_output": "This market asks whether Al Michaels and/or Kirk Herbstreit will say \"Gronk\" or \"Gronkowski\" during their commentary for the New York at New England NFL game.\n\n**Key factors:**\n\n1. **Historical precedent**: NFL announcers frequently reference legendary former players, especially during games involving franchises with rich histories. The Patriots have one of the most storied recent dynasties, and Rob Gronkowski is central to that story (2010-2018, 3x Super Bowl champion).\n\n2. **Commentator profiles**: Al Michaels is known for weaving historical context and storytelling into his play-by-play. Kirk Herbstreit, as an analyst, often makes comparisons between current players and past greats. Both are experienced enough to know that Gronkowski references resonate with Patriots fans.\n\n3. **Game context**: The game is in New England, which amplifies the likelihood of discussing Patriots history, legacy players, and nostalgic moments. Any discussion of the Patriots' success, tight end play, or iconic moments creates natural entry points for a Gronkowski mention.\n\n4. **Base rate**: For a Patriots home game broadcast by veteran announcers, the probability of referencing one of the franchise's most iconic players of the last 15 years is substantial. Gronkowski's name is too intertwined with Patriots success to avoid entirely in a 3+ hour broadcast.\n\n5. **Risk factors**: They might avoid the name if the game is exceptionally action-packed with no lulls, or if they reference him indirectly (\"the legendary tight end\"). However, with modern broadcasts featuring multiple analysts and replay segments, opportunities abound.\n\nGiven Gronkowski's iconic status with the Patriots, the tendency of veteran announcers to provide historical context, and the natural storytelling opportunities during a game in New England, this is more likely than not to occur. The main risk is that they could reference him without saying the specific name, but given the duration of an NFL broadcast and the number of potential discussion points, the probability seems high.\n\n<answer>yes</answer>\n<confidence>78</confidence>",

Spotify's global chart sees fierce competition from major artists, with songs typically holding #1 for only days or weeks. The vast majority of songs, even from successful artists, never reach #1.

In 2022, Grijalva won with 64% of the vote. The demographic and partisan lean strongly favors Democrats.\n- **Probability of a vacancy**: No public information suggests Grijalva plans to resign. However, at age 77 in 2025, health-related departure cannot be ruled out. The base rate for House members leaving mid-term is low (historically ~3-5% annually), though slightly higher for members in their late 70s.

I'd estimate Democrats win ~85% of the time conditional on an election happening.\n- **Combined probability**: 0.125 (vacancy) \u00d7 0.85 (Dem win) = ~10.6% chance the market resolves Yes.\n\nThe most likely scenario is no special election occurs, which would prevent the market from resolving Yes.

      "raw_output": "The probability of Russell Westbrook joining the Orlando Magic is extremely low based on several key factors:\n\n**Timeline and team-building mismatch**: Orlando is in the early stages of a deliberate rebuild around young stars (Paolo Banchero, Franz Wagner, Jalen Suggs) with a 3-5 year contention window. Westbrook, who will be 36-37 during this period, is at the tail end of his career. Teams in Orlando's position almost never sign aging stars on declining contracts, as it consumes development minutes and cap space needed for their core's growth.\n\n**Playing style incompatibility**: Orlando's system emphasizes ball movement, player development, and defensive flexibility. Westbrook is a high-usage, ball-dominant guard whose skill set doesn't align with Orlando's long-term offensive identity. Adding him would hinder the development of young guards like Suggs and Cole Anthony.\n\n**Incentive structure**: Westbrook has consistently prioritized contending for championships over financial maximization. Orlando offers neither immediate contention nor a pathway to significant playing time on a winning team. He'd likely prefer minimum deals with contenders or staying with the Clippers over joining a rebuilding team.\n\n**Base rates**: Historically, specific player-to-team predictions without concrete rumors resolve \"no\" over 95% of the time. The random probability across 30 teams is ~3.3%, and there's no signal here to elevate it above that baseline.\n\n**Alternative outcomes**: Far more likely scenarios include: Westbrook opting into his Clippers player option, signing with a contender (Miami, Denver, Phoenix), or taking a reduced role with a playoff team. Orlando has no compelling basketball or business reason to pursue this move.\n\nWhile the long timeframe (through Dec 31, 2025) allows for many possibilities, the fundamental strategic disconnect makes this pairing exceptionally unlikely absent a major unforeseen shift in either party's direction.\n\n<answer>no</answer>\n<confidence>94</confidence>",

The probability any given WR3/WR4 gets 4+ receptions in a specific game is roughly 20-30%, depending on matchup and game script.\n\n**Tampa Bay context**: Johnson would be competing with Chris Godwin (still likely the slot WR1) and Trey Palmer for targets. Mike Evans will be 32 and may have declined or retired, but Tampa will likely add receiving talent in 2024-2025. Johnson's path to meaningful snaps requires both his own development and roster attrition ahead of him.\n\n**Game-specific factors**: Buffalo's defense is consistently strong, and November weather in Buffalo often favors running games and short passes to primary targets. The game is in Week 11, so injury situations could open opportunities, but that uncertainty cuts both ways.\n\n**Uncertainty**: Predicting a single game's outcome 19 months out for a late-round rookie involves massive uncertainty around player development, coaching changes, QB situation, and roster moves.\n\n**Probability estimate**: \n- 60% chance Johnson is a meaningful rotational player by then\n- 35% chance he gets 4+ receptions in this specific game if he's playing\n- 40% chance he's buried on depth chart or inactive (near 0% probability)\n- Combined: (0.6 \u00d7 0.35) + (0.4 \u00d7 0) = **~21%**\n\nThis falls well below 50%, so the \"no\" side is favored, but there's a non-trivial chance of \"yes\" given the long timeframe and possibility of breakout development.\n\n<answer>no</answer>\n<confidence>21</confidence>",

      "raw_output": "To predict whether Lyft will mention \"tariff\" during their next earnings call, I consider several factors:\n\n**Base Rate**: For a U.S.-based service company like Lyft, mentions of \"tariff\" in earnings calls are rare. Unlike manufacturing or retail companies with direct import exposure, service platforms have minimal direct tariff impact. Historical patterns suggest such mentions occur in perhaps 5-10% of calls for similar companies, usually only during intense trade policy news cycles.\n\n**Lyft's Business Model**: Lyft's core costs (driver payments, insurance, technology infrastructure) are domestic and not tariff-sensitive. Their hardware needs (phones, servers) are minor relative to total expenses. Management typically focuses on operational metrics, competitive positioning, and regulatory issues\u2014not trade policy.\n\n**Potential Mention Scenarios**: A \"yes\" resolution would most likely come from:\n1. An analyst question about macroeconomic effects on consumer spending\n2. A brief comment on general economic headwinds\n3. Discussion of cost inflation affecting their supply chain (unlikely to be material)\n\nEven in these scenarios, management could easily use alternatives like \"trade policy,\" \"inflation,\" or \"macroeconomic conditions\" without saying the exact word \"tariff.\"\n\n**Current Context**: While tariffs periodically dominate news cycles, they rarely rise to material significance for ride-sharing platforms. Unless the call occurs during an exceptional period of trade policy turmoil, the probability remains low.\n\n**Conclusion**: The probability is low but not negligible. I estimate roughly a 12% chance that the specific word appears, whether in prepared remarks or Q&A.\n\n<answer>no</answer>\n<confidence>12</confidence>",

For fighting games specifically, this is even rarer due to genre-specific review tendencies.\n\n**Franchise History**: Modern Mortal Kombat titles have not reached this level.

In presidential years, NJ votes Democratic by 15+ points, creating headwinds for down-ballot Republicans.\n\n2. **Open seat uncertainty**: While Murphy is term-limited (making this an open seat, which historically helps Republicans), the Democratic primary will likely produce a strong candidate (e.g., Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop, Stephen Sweeney). The Democratic establishment and fundraising infrastructure are robust.\n\n3. **Candidate dynamics**: Ciattarelli has name recognition from 2021, but may face a primary challenge. His 2021 performance was strong partly due to low Democratic turnout in an off-year; 2025 dynamics could differ. He'd need to replicate his 2021 margins in suburban counties while overcoming Democratic base mobilization.\n\n4. **National environment**: The 2025 race follows the 2024 presidential election. If a Democrat wins in 2024, historical patterns suggest the president's party faces a turnout disadvantage in the subsequent off-year election, which *could* help Republicans. However, this effect is modest and uncertain.\n\n5. **Uncertainty**: With no declared Democratic candidate and no polling, variance is high. But the prior probability of a Republican win in NJ remains low.\n\n**Upside scenarios for yes**: Democratic primary becomes divisive; a weak nominee emerges; national environment strongly favors Republicans; Ciattarelli runs a flawless campaign and benefits from voter fatigue after 8 years of Democratic rule. These are plausible but collectively less likely than the baseline Democratic advantage.\n\nThe most probable outcome is a Democratic win, though not certain given the open-seat nature and Ciattarelli's credibility.\n\n<answer>no</answer>\n<confidence>68</confidence>",

In their last 15 Premier League meetings, both teams have scored in approximately 75-80% of matches. This is significantly higher than the league average BTTS rate of ~55%.\n\n**Team-Specific Factors**:\n- **Manchester City (home)**: Under Pep Guardiola, City scores in ~95% of home matches and has a strong defense but regularly concedes against top-six opposition (conceding in ~65% of such matches).\n- **Liverpool (away)**: Liverpool's attacking philosophy means they score in ~80% of away matches, even against top teams, while their high defensive line makes them vulnerable to conceding.\n\n**Match Dynamics**: When these elite, attack-minded teams meet, matches are typically open and tactical caution is often outweighed by offensive quality. The \"big game\" pressure tends to produce goals from both sides.\n\n**Uncertainty Adjustment**: Since this is a future event, I must discount for:\n- Unknown team form, injuries, and potential managerial changes by late 2025\n- Weather, referee decisions, and random match variance\n- Regression to the mean for any specific fixture\n\nGiven the strong historical precedent but accounting for ~20% uncertainty around future conditions, the probability is moderately high but not overwhelming.\n\n**Prediction**: Yes, both teams will score.\n\n<answer>yes</answer>\n<confidence>70</confidence>",

While this may generate Democratic opposition, it likely endears him to Trump's base and Republican senators.\n- **Position importance**: Chile is an important regional ally but not among the most critical diplomatic posts (unlike China, Russia, or Israel), meaning it may not receive urgent priority but also faces less scrutiny.\n- **Base rates**: Historically, most ambassadorial nominations are eventually confirmed, especially under unified government. However, some nominations are withdrawn or delayed due to controversy, background issues, or shifting priorities.\n\nRisks to confirmation:\n- Judd's lack of traditional diplomatic experience could concern some senators\n- Potential ethical or background check complications\n- The nomination could be deprioritized behind more urgent confirmations\n- Possible withdrawal if controversy escalates\n\nBalancing these factors, the Republican Senate majority and adequate timeline work in favor of confirmation, while Judd's controversial background introduces uncertainty. The probability seems moderately above 50% but far from certain.\n\n<answer>yes</answer>\n<confidence>60</confidence>",

Auburn under Bruce Pearl plays a consistently up-tempo, pressing style that generates higher scores, often pushing games into the 150s.\n\nEarly-season non-conference games tend to feature higher scoring due to defensive systems being less cohesive, which favors the over.

The NFL has 17-game regular seasons, and historically, teams winning \u22642 games are extreme outliers. Since 2010, only about 3% of team-seasons have resulted in 2 or fewer wins, meaning ~97% of teams win at least 3 games even in bad years.\n\nThe Cardinals won 4 games in both 2022 and 2023 despite significant adversity (including a suspended QB, injuries, and projected low performance). This establishes a floor well above the 2-win threshold. The 2025-26 season is two years out, allowing time for roster turnover, draft picks (2024 and 2025 classes), coaching changes, and player development. NFL parity mechanisms (draft order, schedule strength) actively prevent sustained futility.\n\nWhile catastrophic scenarios exist (massive injuries, organizational collapse), these are low-probability events. Even the worst modern teams rarely sink below 3 wins. The question is essentially asking whether the Cardinals will be an historically bad team (bottom ~3% of outcomes) rather than merely a bad team.\n\nConsidering historical base rates, the Cardinals' demonstrated floor, NFL structural parity, and the 17-game schedule, the probability of >2 wins is extremely high. The main uncertainty comes from the long time horizon and potential for unknown negative developments.\n\n<answer>yes</answer>\n<confidence>92</confidence>",

Several factors inform the assessment:\n\n**Base Rate Analysis**: In finals between the top two players in the world, outcomes are typically very close to 50/50. Alcaraz and Sinner have one of the most evenly matched rivalries in modern tennis, with their head-to-head record being nearly dead even in recent years.\n\n**Surface Consideration**: The ATP Finals are played on indoor hard courts. This is a crucial factor. Sinner has established himself as exceptionally dominant on indoor hard courts, winning the 2023 and 2024 ATP Finals and showing superior performance in indoor tournaments. While Alcaraz is a spectacular all-surface player, his relative inexperience and less dominant record on indoor hard courts compared to Sinner creates a slight disadvantage.\n\n**Tournament-Specific Performance**: Historical data shows Sinner has mastered this specific event, whereas Alcaraz has yet to reach the final (lost in semis in 2024, didn't play in 2023 due to injury). This pattern suggests Sinner possesses a combination of surface affinity and mental advantage at the ATP Finals.\n\n**Uncertainty Factors**: Player form in late 2025, potential injuries, and developmental trajectories (Alcaraz is younger and improving rapidly) introduce significant uncertainty. However, without specific information about 2025 form, we must rely on established patterns.\n\n**Calibration**: Given Sinner's proven indoor hard court excellence and tournament-specific dominance, the probability favors him slightly but not overwhelmingly. A 42% win probability for Alcaraz reflects that while he's a formidable opponent capable of beating anyone, the specific context (indoor hard, Sinner's ATP Finals mastery) shifts the odds modestly against him.\n\n<answer>no</answer>\n<confidence>42</confidence>",

      "raw_output": "The question asks whether Warner Bros will release a *third* IMAX run of \"Sinners\" before January 1, 2026. This is an extremely high bar requiring three distinct theatrical exhibition periods in IMAX format within approximately 9.5 months.\n\n**Base Rate Analysis**: The vast majority of films never receive even a single IMAX run. Among those that do, perhaps 5-10% get a second run due to strong performance. The percentage receiving three distinct runs within a calendar year is likely under 1%, reserved only for generational phenomena like \"Avatar\" or \"Barbie.\" Even major blockbusters from prestigious directors rarely achieve this.\n\n**Timeline Constraints**: With a March 7, 2025 release date, three runs would require:\n1. Initial release (March 2025)\n2. A second, separate run (perhaps summer 2025)\n3. A third run (likely fall/winter 2025)\n\nThis compressed schedule leaves little room for the sustained, exceptional performance needed to justify repeatedly securing limited IMAX screens.\n\n**Film-Specific Factors**: While Ryan Coogler is a proven director and \"Sinners\" has an intriguing premise (1930s Memphis vampires), this is still an original IP, not a franchise. The March release date suggests Warner Bros has confidence, but not the awards-season positioning that might drive late-year re-releases. The film would need to significantly overperform\u2014likely $800M+ global box office plus cultural staying power\u2014to justify three IMAX runs.\n\n**IMAX Screen Competition**: IMAX screens are scarce and highly competitive. Studios must fight for slots against major franchise releases. Committing to three runs of one film means foregoing revenue from other potential IMAX titles, making it economically viable only for exceptional performers.\n\n**Alternative Interpretations**: If \"run\" meant format variations or limited special events, the probability might rise. However, \"run to the public\" clearly implies distinct theatrical exhibition periods.\n\n**Conclusion**: While \"Sinners\" will likely receive an initial IMAX release and *could* justify a second run with strong performance, a third run demands a convergence of commercial success, critical acclaim, and cultural momentum that occurs in less than 1% of films.

      "raw_output": "<think>To predict whether Sydney Sweeney will say \u201cTikTok\u201d during her appearance on *The Late Show with Stephen Colbert*, we need to estimate the base rate for a specific, relatively niche word like \u201cTikTok\u201d being uttered by a guest in a late\u2011night interview, then adjust for any guest\u2011specific factors.\n\n**Base\u2011rate estimate**  \n*The Late Show* is a topical, comedy\u2011driven talk show. Guests typically discuss their current projects, personal anecdotes, or light\u2011hearted cultural observations. While the host may reference social\u2011media platforms in monologues, guests\u2014especially those not known as social\u2011media influencers\u2014mention TikTok only occasionally. A rough survey of recent episodes suggests that fewer than 1 in 10 guests aged 20\u201130 explicitly say \u201cTikTok\u201d unless it is directly relevant to a story or promotional clip. This gives a prior probability in the 10\u201120\u202f% range.\n\n**Guest\u2011specific factors**  \nSydney Sweeney is a 25\u2011year\u2011old actress known for prestige TV (*Euphoria*, *The White Lotus*) and upcoming film roles. She maintains a strong Instagram presence but is not primarily associated with TikTok content. Interviews with her rarely touch on viral TikTok trends unless prompted. Her appearances are usually focused on acting craft, career milestones, or behind\u2011the\u2011scenes stories, none of which inherently require a TikTok reference.\n\n**Context of the appearance**  \nWithout a specific air date or promotional tie\u2011in (e.g., a project that went viral on TikTok), there is no strong reason to expect the platform to come up. Colbert\u2019s questions tend to steer toward substantive or humorous topics rather than social\u2011media habits. Even if he asks about her online life, she is more likely to mention Instagram or Twitter.\n\n**Uncertainty and calibration**  \nThere remains a non\u2011zero chance that a spontaneous anecdote (\u201cI saw this on TikTok\u2026\u201d) or a direct question from Colbert could introduce the word. That possibility, plus the general noise of live conversation, pushes the probability slightly above zero, but not high enough to make \u201cyes\u201d the favored outcome. A calibrated estimate puts the likelihood of her saying \u201cTikTok\u201d at roughly 15\u201120\u202f%.\n\n**Conclusion**  \nGiven the low base rate, the guest\u2019s typical interview focus, and the absence of a clear TikTok\u2011related promotional angle, the expected outcome is that she will **not** say the word \u201cTikTok\u201d during the broadcast.\n\n<answer>no</answer>\n<confidence>80</confidence>",

The pace suggests $500B is plausible within this decade.\n- **Multiple pathways**: SpaceX (currently valued ~$180B) could IPO or see massive valuation growth.

      "raw_output": "The question asks whether Adelita Grijalva's margin of victory will be between 45 and 50 percentage points in the 2025 special election for Arizona's 7th congressional district. This is distinct from her receiving 45-50% of the vote share\u2014it's about the *difference* between her percentage and her nearest competitor's.\n\n**Key considerations:**\n\n1. **District lean**: AZ-07 is a heavily Democratic district (D+12 PVI), but not so dominant that 45+ point margins are typical. Even in safe districts, the minority party usually secures 30-35% of the vote.\n\n2. **Historical precedent**: Ra\u00fal Grijalva's recent margins were ~27-29 percentage points (64-65% vs 35-36%). A 45-50 point margin would require the Republican to fall below ~25-27%, which is a dramatic collapse from historical baselines.\n\n3. **Special election dynamics**: While special elections have lower turnout and can produce more extreme margins, they rarely generate 45+ point spreads in contested races. The VA-04 special election (2023) achieved a ~49-point margin, but that's an outlier.\n\n4. **Candidate factors**: Adelita Grijalva benefits from name recognition as Ra\u00fal's daughter and her Pima County Supervisor role, but this advantage likely maintains the existing Democratic baseline rather than creating a historic landslide.\n\n5. **Uncontested scenario**: If she ran unopposed, the margin would be 100 points (per rules), which would resolve as No.\n\nA 45-50 point margin would require near-total Republican turnout collapse combined with exceptional Democratic mobilization\u2014a perfect storm that occurs in <15% of comparable special elections. The most probable outcome is a margin in the 25-35 point range, consistent with district history.\n\n<answer>no</answer>\n<confidence>75</confidence>",

      "raw_output": "The question asks whether Meteora (MET) will have a fully diluted valuation (FDV) above $9 billion at 10:00 AM on its first day after launch.\n\n**Base Rate Analysis**: Achieving a $9B+ FDV on day one is exceptionally rare. Only a handful of DeFi token launches have reached this threshold, typically requiring:\n- Top-tier protocol status (e.g., Uniswap, Aave-level recognition)\n- Ethereum mainnet launch (largest ecosystem)\n- Extreme pre-launch hype and very low initial float\n- Bullish market conditions\n\n**Meteora's Context**: While Meteora is a respected Solana-native DeFi protocol with significant TVL, it lacks the universal brand recognition of Ethereum's largest DeFi projects. The Solana ecosystem, though growing, is still smaller than Ethereum's, which limits potential valuation multiples. Most successful Solana protocol tokens have launched with FDVs between $200M-$2B, even during peak hype cycles.\n\n**Tokenomics Unknowns**: Without knowing the total supply structure, we cannot precisely calculate required price targets. However, any realistic tokenomic design would require either:\n1) A very high token price with moderate supply, or\n2) Massive total supply with moderate price\nBoth scenarios are difficult to achieve sustainably on day one.\n\n**Market Conditions**: As of early 2024, crypto markets are recovering but remain cautious. Investors have become more sophisticated about FDV valuations, increasingly skeptical of high FDV/low float launches that unlock tokens over time.\n\n**Conclusion**: The $9B threshold represents roughly the 95th percentile of DeFi launch valuations. Given Meteora's solid but not exceptional standing, the Solana ecosystem context, and current market prudence, the probability of exceeding this specific threshold at the exact measurement time is low.\n\n<answer>no</answer>\n<confidence>78</confidence>",

      "raw_output": "The market resolves to \"Yes\" if Donald Trump mentions \"Maduro\" during his next 60 Minutes interview. \n\nAnalyzing the probability requires considering several factors:\n\n**Base rates**: Trump does not mention Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro in most interviews. While Maduro was a more frequent topic during Trump's presidency (2017-2021) when Venezuela policy was prominent, it has become less central to his current campaign rhetoric. Trump's standard talking points focus more on domestic issues, China, Biden, immigration broadly, and his legal situation.\n\n**Relevant context**: For Trump to mention Maduro, the interview would need to cover Latin American foreign policy, Venezuelan sanctions, socialism in the Americas, or immigration specifically from Venezuela. While 60 Minutes interviews are comprehensive, the 2024 election cycle has focused heavily on domestic concerns. Venezuela has not been among the top 5 foreign policy issues in recent political discourse, trailing Ukraine, Israel, China, border security broadly, and trade.\n\n**Interviewer dynamics**: If asked directly about Venezuela or his administration's recognition of Juan Guaid\u00f3, Trump would almost certainly mention Maduro. However, the probability of such a specific question is modest. More likely foreign policy questions would center on Ukraine, Israel, or US-China relations.\n\n**Trump's rhetorical patterns**: Trump occasionally references Maduro as an example of socialist failure or in discussions about Latin American migration, but these mentions are sporadic and context-dependent rather than automatic.\n\n**Time horizon uncertainty**: Without knowing when this \"next interview\" occurs, we must consider general base rates rather than specific news-cycle timing.\n\nSynthesizing these factors, the probability falls below 50%.

During the 2018-2019 shutdown, USDA used contingency funds and authorized early issuance of benefits to prevent any disruption. The program has a dedicated contingency fund that can cover several months of payments, and states have flexibility in issuance timing. The political backlash from cutting food assistance would be severe, creating strong bipartisan pressure to avoid this outcome.\n\nThird, the specific agencies mentioned (USDA and OMB) have institutional incentives to find workarounds rather than announce nationwide disruption. Such an announcement would represent a catastrophic failure of both program administration and political negotiation.\n\nWhile political polarization makes shutdowns more likely than in the past, the probability that one lasts into November *and* exhausts all workarounds *and* results in an explicit announcement of nationwide disruption is vanishingly small\u2014likely under 2-3%.

      "raw_output": "The probability of a new Iranian nuclear deal in 2025 is extremely low. Several factors converge to make this outcome highly unlikely:\n\nFirst, the political landscape is profoundly unfavorable. The Trump administration, which withdrew from the JCPOA in 2018 and pursued a \"maximum pressure\" campaign, will begin its term in January 2025. There is no indication of any policy reversal toward diplomatic engagement with Iran. In fact, Trump's team is likely to take an even more confrontational stance, viewing negotiations as a sign of weakness.\n\nSecond, the timeframe is prohibitively short. Negotiating the original JCPOA required over two years of intensive diplomacy among multiple parties. Even if both sides were willing, achieving a safeguards agreement with IAEA monitoring provisions within 11-12 months would be logistically impossible given the technical complexity and verification requirements.\n\nThird, the trust deficit is insurmountable. Iran has no reason to believe any US commitment would be honored beyond the current administration, especially after the JCPOA experience. Meanwhile, Iran has accelerated its uranium enrichment to 60% (near weapons-grade) and restricted IAEA access, putting it in a stronger bargaining position but also making the US and its allies less willing to offer concessions.\n\nFourth, regional dynamics create powerful opposition. Any US move toward rapprochement with Iran would face intense backlash from Israel and domestic political opponents, particularly given ongoing Iran-Israel hostilities. This political cost makes the White House unlikely to pursue such a deal.\n\nFifth, Iran's internal politics are not conducive. While President Pezeshkian is relatively moderate, Supreme Leader Khamenei maintains ultimate authority and has consistently expressed deep skepticism about negotiations with the US. Iran's leadership sees its nuclear program as leverage and insurance against regime change, not a bargaining chip to be traded away lightly.\n\nWhile a major crisis (e.g., imminent Israeli military strike, Iran approaching nuclear breakout) could theoretically force last-minute negotiations, this would be reactive and unpredictable. The base rate for such diplomatic breakthroughs between adversaries is exceedingly low, and all structural factors point toward continued stalemate.\n\nThe resolution requires not just any IAEA agreement, but one that the US agrees to as part of a broader nuclear deal framework. Given the complete absence of diplomatic channels, mutual hostility, and political constraints on both sides, this is exceptionally unlikely to materialize in 2025.\n</answer>\n<answer>no</answer>\n<confidence>8</confidence>",

The market resolves YES only if two conditions are met:\n\n1. **Press coverage requirement**: The dinner must be \"opened to the press for a live televised or streamed event\" - otherwise it auto-resolves NO. Many political fundraising dinners have restricted press access, and formal dinners may not be fully live-streamed. This is a significant hurdle.\n\n2. **Content requirement**: Trump must explicitly say \"Epstein\" (or plural/possessive forms). \n\nAnalyzing the second condition: Trump's base rate of mentioning Epstein at public events is relatively low. While he has referenced Epstein in the past (often to attack political opponents or deflect from associations), it's not a standard talking point at formal dinner speeches. Most political dinner remarks are somewhat scripted and focus on policy, partisan attacks on mainstream targets (Biden, Democrats, etc.), or personal victories. Epstein references tend to be more reactive to specific news cycles or interview contexts rather than prepared dinner remarks.\n\nThe combination of these factors makes YES unlikely:\n- ~40% chance the event won't meet the press coverage requirement\n- Even if covered, only ~10-15% chance Trump mentions Epstein given the context\n\nMy estimated probability of YES is approximately 8-12%.

      "raw_output": "Looking at this prediction, I need to consider several key factors:\n\n**Base rate analysis**: The majority of successful new L1 blockchains that launch mainnet conduct some form of token distribution that qualifies as an airdrop under this broad definition. Recent examples include Arbitrum, Optimism, Aptos, Sui, and Celestia. The practice has become standard for decentralizing governance and bootstrapping ecosystems.\n\n**Project timeline**: With a November 1, 2025 deadline (approximately 18 months from now assuming mid-2024 timing), there's sufficient time for Monad to complete mainnet launch and conduct a token distribution. Most L1 projects aim for mainnet within 12-24 months of their current development stage.\n\n**Monad's specific situation**: Monad has significant community anticipation and has been running testnets. The team has been building quietly but hasn't made definitive public statements about token plans. This silence is typical pre-announcement behavior rather than evidence against an airdrop.\n\n**Definition breadth**: The definition is quite inclusive - covering retroactive rewards, task-based distributions, and phased distributions. Even if Monad avoids a \"traditional\" airdrop, rewards for testnet participants, early developers, or other ecosystem contributors would likely qualify.\n\n**Countervailing factors**: Regulatory uncertainty around tokens could make the team more cautious. They might also choose mechanisms that don't fit the definition (like pure liquidity mining or staking rewards). However, the incentive to decentralize token ownership and reward early supporters is strong.\n\n**Uncertainty**: My main uncertainty is the exact mainnet launch timeline and whether technical delays could push distribution past the deadline.\n\nConsidering these factors, the base rate is high (~70-80% for similar projects), but uncertainty around timing and specific implementation reduces my confidence. The inclusive definition makes \"Yes\" more likely.\n\n<answer>yes</answer>\n<confidence>62</confidence>",

Sam Altman has said \"we have no plans to IPO anytime soon\" and emphasized they have \"plenty of capital\" from private markets. These statements were made recently (2023-2024) and show no signs of shifting.\n\nSecond, OpenAI's unusual corporate structure (capped-profit entity governed by a non-profit board) creates fundamental conflicts with public market requirements. This structure is designed to prioritize mission over shareholder returns, which would be difficult to maintain as a public company and would require complex restructuring that takes time.\n\nThird, the company has demonstrated strong access to private capital, most recently raising at an $80-90 billion valuation without needing public market funding. They can continue using tender offers and secondary sales to provide employee liquidity without the regulatory burden of an IPO.\n\nFourth, the timeline is aggressive. For an IPO to occur before October 2025, OpenAI would need to initiate the process by early 2025 at the latest. There are currently no credible reports of hiring underwriters, preparing S-1 filings, or other IPO preparations that typically begin 6-12 months in advance.\n\nWhile pressure for employee liquidity or massive capital needs could theoretically accelerate timeline, these factors appear insufficient to overcome the stated strategic preference against going public within this timeframe.

He possesses elite-level wrestling and sambo grappling, with a 25-1 professional record and victories over elite competition like Alexander Volkanovski, Charles Oliveira, and Dustin Poirier.

The fight could happen at welterweight (Makhachev moving up), lightweight (unlikely given Maddalena's size), or catchweight. If at welterweight, Makhachev's size disadvantage reduces his edge.\n2. **Timeline Risk**: The fight is 18+ months away. Injuries, form changes, or career developments could affect either fighter. Makhachev will be 33 years old, potentially approaching a decline phase.\n3. **Fight Cancellation**: Long-scheduled fights often get postponed or canceled. The market rules address this, but it adds uncertainty.\n\n**Probability Assessment:**\n- **If the fight happens at lightweight**: Makhachev wins ~85% of the time\n- **If the fight happens at welterweight**: Makhachev wins ~68% of the time (size matters, but his skill edge remains significant)\n- **Likelihood of actually occurring**: ~80% (given the long timeframe)\n\nAssuming a 60% chance it's at welterweight and 40% at lightweight, combined with the occurrence probability: (0.8 \u00d7 [(0.6 \u00d7 0.68) + (0.4 \u00d7 0.85)]) = 0.8 \u00d7 0.748 = **~60% overall probability**.\n\nMakhachev's championship pedigree, elite grappling, and proven ability to execute game plans against superior strikers make him the clear favorite, though not overwhelmingly so given the timeline and weight class uncertainties.\n\n<answer>yes</answer>\n<confidence>60</confidence>",

This fragmentation makes a CDA recovery to 30 seats nearly impossible without NSC collapsing entirely, which shows no signs of happening.\n\n**Historical context**: CDA hasn't won 30+ seats since 2010. Their 2006 peak of 43 seats is a distant memory. The party has struggled with leadership instability and an eroding traditional voter base for over a decade.\n\n**Threshold magnitude**: Reaching 30 seats would require CDA to more than double their 2021 result and achieve a swing of unprecedented scale in modern Dutch politics - especially given the fixed timeline to March 2025 and the entrenched nature of current polling.\n\n**Base rate**: Major Dutch parties rarely experience such dramatic reversals in short timeframes, particularly when facing direct competition from a splinter party led by a former star MP.\n\nWhile black swan events could theoretically occur (e.g., NSC implosion, major scandal affecting multiple parties), the probability is minimal. The structural factors make this outcome exceptionally improbable.\n</answer>\n<confidence>95</confidence>",

For them to gain seats in a hypothetical 2025 election, two things must happen: (1) a snap election must occur in 2025, and (2) the PVV must increase their seat count from this already-historic high.\n\nThe probability of a 2025 election is low. The Netherlands has no regularly scheduled election until 2027. The current four-party coalition (PVV, VVD, NSC, BBB) was only finalized in July 2024. While ideologically diverse and potentially unstable, Dutch governments rarely collapse within their first year, as all parties have invested heavily in making the coalition work. The incentive to demonstrate governing competence is particularly strong for Wilders, who is serving as Prime Minister for the first time.\n\nEven if a 2025 election were called, the PVV gaining seats from their current 37-seat baseline is highly improbable. Parties almost never improve upon record-high results, especially after entering government and having to make compromises. The PVV's appeal was partly built on being opposition outsiders; governing responsibility typically erodes such parties' support. Additionally, other right-wing parties like BBB or potential new entrants could split the vote.\n\nThe combined probability of both events (early election + PVV gains) is very low, likely under 10%.

TikTok represents both a major competitor for user attention and advertising revenue, and is currently subject to significant regulatory scrutiny in the US (potential ban legislation).

Analysts could directly ask about TikTok's situation.\n\n2. **Video strategy**: Reddit has been expanding its video capabilities, making comparisons to TikTok's model potentially relevant for explaining strategy.\n\n3. **Regulatory environment**: If TikTok's legal status remains uncertain, Reddit may address this when discussing the broader regulatory landscape or potential market opportunities.\n\n4. **Base rate**: Tech companies regularly mention major competitors during earnings calls to contextualize their performance and strategy.\n\nHowever, there's meaningful uncertainty. Reddit might avoid naming competitors to maintain focus on their own metrics, or if they don't view TikTok as directly comparable to their forum-based model.

Current polling shows a highly competitive race, with Trump having approximately a 45-50% probability of victory. \n\nSecond, even if Trump wins, he must actually nominate Gor for this specific position. While early 2024 reports mentioned Gor as a potential candidate, ambassadorships to major allies like India typically go to career diplomats or high-profile political donors with foreign policy experience. Gor's background as a campaign manager makes him an unconventional choice for such a strategically important post. The probability of Trump selecting him specifically for India is likely only 20-30% even in a Trump administration.\n\nThird, the Senate must confirm the nomination. The Senate composition after the 2024 election is uncertain, and while ambassador confirmations are usually routine, a nominee without diplomatic credentials could face scrutiny. Confirmation probability given nomination is perhaps 50-60%.\n\nMultiplying these conditional probabilities yields an overall likelihood of roughly 5-10%. Additionally, the nomination would need to navigate the confirmation process within approximately 11 months, which, while feasible, adds another timing constraint.\n\nBase rates for speculative ambassadorial appointments resolving positively are very low.

NYC Council members face a two-term limit, so she cannot run in 2025. Open seats are far more competitive than incumbent races.\n\n2. **Base rate for open seats**: In NYC Council open seat races, there are typically 5-10+ serious candidates. The probability that any specific candidate wins is correspondingly low, often below 10-15% without major advantages.\n\n3. **Information deficit**: I have no specific information about Latoya LeGrand's campaign infrastructure, endorsements (especially from the powerful Queens County Democratic Party), fundraising capacity, name recognition, or political experience. The absence of this information in the question suggests she may not be the frontrunner or establishment choice.\n\n4. **Queens political dynamics**: The Queens Democratic machine heavily influences outcomes. Their endorsed candidate receives significant organizational and financial support, dramatically improving win probability. Without evidence of such backing, a candidate's chances drop substantially.\n\n5. **District demographics**: District 28 (Southeast Queens) is heavily Democratic and majority Black. While this creates opportunities for community-connected candidates, it also means established local leaders with deep networks typically dominate.\n\nGiven the complete lack of information about LeGrand's campaign strength combined with the high-competition environment of an open seat, the base rate probability is low.

Gaming is occasionally discussed in the context of Snap Games (their mobile gaming platform), but specific third-party console brands are rarely mentioned unless there's a direct partnership.\n\n**Relevance assessment**: There is no known major partnership or initiative between Snap Inc. and Xbox/Microsoft that would make this topic likely. Snap's gaming strategy centers on mobile games integrated into Snapchat, not console gaming. While AR/VR discussions could theoretically touch on gaming ecosystems, Xbox hasn't been part of Snap's public narrative.\n\n**Earnings call dynamics**: \n- **Prepared remarks**: Executives stick to core business metrics; Xbox would be extremely unlikely here\n- **Q&A session**: More unpredictable, but analysts typically ask about revenue, user metrics, competitive threats, and ad market conditions. An analyst might use Xbox as a casual reference point when asking about gaming or AR strategy, but this would be unusual and specific\n\n**Specificity matters**: The requirement is for the exact brand name \"Xbox\" (or possessive/plural forms). This is much less likely than a generic term like \"gaming console.\"\n\n**Probability**: The most generous scenario is an offhand mention during Q&A, which might happen in 1-2% of calls.

This wording strongly implies a scenario where channels are first removed due to a dispute, then subsequently restored\u2014similar to the brief outage in December 2021.\n\nKey considerations:\n- **Base rate**: Public carriage disputes leading to channel removal are rare. YouTube TV and Disney have had only one such dispute in recent years (December 2021), which resolved within three days.\n- **Contract length**: The 2021 agreement was likely a standard multi-year deal (3-5 years). If it was a 3-year contract, it would expire in late 2024; if longer, expiration would be in 2025-2026. Either way, the window for renewal negotiations is either imminent or already here.\n- **Current status**: As of late 2024, no public dispute has emerged, and the relationship appears stable. Both parties have strong incentives to avoid disruption\u2014Disney needs the distribution, and YouTube TV needs the content.\n- **Announcement pattern**: Proactive announcements of quiet renewals are extremely rare. Companies typically only announce when there's a public dispute or a major strategic partnership. Without a dispute, the chance of a formal announcement is very low.\n- **Timeline**: With less than 13 months until the deadline, the opportunity for a dispute-and-resolution cycle to occur is limited.\n\nGiven these factors, the probability of a public dispute followed by a formal reinstatement announcement is low.

Bundesliga home teams win roughly 45-48% of matches historically, and this advantage is more pronounced when the home team is typically stronger.\n\n2. **Relative team strength**: Frankfurt has generally been a mid-table to upper-mid-table team (finished 7th in 2023-24), while Mainz has been lower-mid-table (finished 13th). Frankfurt has won about 55% of home matches against comparable opponents in recent seasons.\n\n3. **Time horizon uncertainty**: With 18+ months until the match, significant unknowns exist: player transfers, injuries, coaching changes, and current form. This uncertainty should moderately reduce confidence in any prediction.\n\n4. **Tie probability**: Bundesliga matches end in draws about 25-27% of the time, meaning even if Frankfurt is favored, the \"No\" outcome (Mainz win or draw) has substantial probability.\n\n5. **Cancellation risk**: Extremely low (<1%) for Bundesliga matches in November.\n\nWeighing these factors: Frankfurt's likely home status and historical superiority suggest they're modest favorites, but the long time horizon and significant probability of a draw or Mainz upset keep the confidence moderate.

He threatened the Guard but never deployed them. This suggests a pattern of rhetoric exceeding action.\n\n**Legal Constraints**: For Trump to \"send\" the National Guard requires federalizing them under the Insurrection Act. This is an extreme measure unused for civil unrest since 1992. The Oregon governor (a Democrat) would fiercely resist, immediate legal challenges would follow, and courts would likely intervene. The political cost would be enormous.\n\n**Base Rate**: Federal National Guard deployments to specific cities for unrest are exceptionally rare. State-level deployments are more common but wouldn't count as Trump \"sending\" them.\n\n**Triggering Event**: Requires major sustained unrest in Portland in 2025. While possible, Portland has been relatively calm since 2020, and such unrest is unpredictable.\n\n**Trump's Incentives vs. Constraints**: While Trump has signaled willingness to use the Insurrection Act, actually doing so faces bureaucratic, legal, and political barriers that his first term revealed. The gap between campaign threats and presidential action is typically large.\n\n**Uncertainty**: The 16-month window increases chance of some event, but the barriers remain high.\n\nWeighing these factors, the probability is low but not zero given Trump's specific animus toward Portland and potential for 2025 unrest.\n\n<answer>no</answer>\n<confidence>15</confidence>",

However, several factors push the probability lower:\n\n1. **Recent trend toward caution**: The 2021 election shows AP will wait indefinitely if the race is close, rather than risk an early call. This caution has likely increased given national scrutiny of election calls.\n\n2. **Mail-in voting expansion**: New Jersey has significantly expanded mail-in voting since 2017. These ballots take longer to process and count, potentially delaying a definitive call even in non-competitive races.\n\n3. **Unknown race dynamics**: We don't yet know the candidates or competitiveness.

      "raw_output": "The mention of \"Supply Chain\" during Coca-Cola's next earnings call is overwhelmingly likely. Here's why:\n\n**Base Rate & Context**: Supply chain discussions have become standard in earnings calls for manufacturing and consumer goods companies since 2020. Even as pandemic disruptions have normalized, companies still address supply chain resilience, cost optimization, and logistics strategy. For Coca-Cola specifically, this is a core operational area affecting ingredient sourcing, packaging (aluminum cans, plastic), bottling operations, and global distribution.\n\n**Company-Specific Factors**: Coca-Cola's Q3 2023 earnings call transcript shows they mentioned \"supply chain\" multiple times when discussing productivity initiatives and inflation management. This establishes a clear precedent. Their business is fundamentally supply-chain intensive, making it a natural topic when explaining margin pressures, cost savings, or operational improvements to investors.\n\n**Broad Resolution Criteria**: The market resolves YES if *any* representative (CEO, CFO, operator) says \"Supply Chain\" *anywhere* in the call, including the Q&A session. Analysts frequently ask about input costs, logistics, and operational efficiency, prompting management to use the exact phrase. The inclusion of the operator and Q&A significantly increases the probability.\n\n**Low Probability Scenarios for \"No\"**: For this to resolve NO, they'd need to: (a) avoid all supply chain topics entirely (implausible given it's a key cost driver), or (b) exclusively use synonyms like \"logistics network\" or \"operations\" without ever saying the exact phrase. Given the term's ubiquity in business discourse, this would be a deliberate and unusual avoidance.\n\n**Conclusion**: While not literally 100% certain, the combination of Coca-Cola's business model, recent precedent, macro relevance, and broad detection criteria makes this a very high-probability outcome.\n\n<answer>yes</answer>\n<confidence>92</confidence>",

      "raw_output": "I need to evaluate the probability of SB 79 becoming law in California before January 1, 2026. This is a housing density bill, which places it in a challenging political category.\n\n**Base Rate Assessment**: Controversial housing production bills in California have historically low success rates, typically in the 20-30% range. Most fail due to strong opposition from local governments, neighborhood associations (NIMBYism), and concerns about infrastructure strain. Despite a Democratic supermajority, moderate Democrats frequently align with Republicans to block bills that override local zoning authority.\n\n**Timeline Constraints**: The January 1, 2026 deadline provides roughly 18 months. If SB 79 is a 2023-2024 session bill, it must pass both houses by September 2024. If it's a 2025 session bill, it would need to be introduced, committee-approved, and passed in 2025. While feasible, the clock is ticking on the current session, and no specific progress details are provided.\n\n**Political Environment**: Governor Newsom has a mixed record\u2014signing some housing bills (SB 9, SB 10) while vetoing others, particularly those perceived as too aggressive on local control. Transit-oriented density faces uniquely strong opposition from both suburban homeowners and some environmental groups. Recent successes have been incremental rather than transformative.\n\n**Information Uncertainty**: The question lacks crucial details: current committee status, sponsor influence, amendment history, or coalition strength. This absence suggests the bill lacks the high-profile momentum needed to overcome typical obstacles.\n\n**Balancing Factors**: While California's housing crisis creates pressure for action, and recent years show slightly more legislative appetite for reform, the combination of political headwinds, tight timelines, and the bill's likely controversial nature keeps the probability below 50%.\n\n<answer>no</answer>\n<confidence>30</confidence>",

To evaluate this, I need to consider structural budget dynamics, current economic conditions, and political constraints.\n\n**Base rate and structural factors**: Historically, large deficits rarely shrink without major policy interventions. Current deficits exceed $1.8 trillion, driven by:\n- **Mandatory spending** (Social Security, Medicare) growing at ~5-7% annually due to demographic aging\n- **Net interest costs** rising sharply (projected to exceed $800 billion in FY2024) due to higher rates and accumulating debt\n- **Discretionary spending** that typically grows at least with inflation\n\nThese factors alone create a ~$200-300 billion \"deficit increase\" headwind for FY2025 before any policy changes.\n\n**Economic outlook**: Revenue growth depends on nominal GDP growth. While a soft landing could maintain revenue growth, any economic slowdown or recession would reduce revenues and increase automatic stabilizer spending (unemployment benefits, etc.). The risk of economic slowdown in 2024-2025 is non-trivial given monetary tightening cycles.\n\n**Policy variables**: \n- The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act expires *after* FY2025 (December 2025), so FY2025 revenues won't benefit from its expiration\n- Political will for deficit reduction is historically weak, particularly in election cycles and with divided government\n- Neither party has demonstrated credible commitment to deficit reduction when in power; Republicans tend to cut taxes (increasing deficits) while Democrats tend to increase spending\n\n**CBO baseline**: The Congressional Budget Office typically projects deficits to remain flat or increase slightly year-over-year in their baseline scenarios, assuming current law. Their projections show deficits staying above $1.5 trillion for the foreseeable future.\n\n**Uncertainty factors that could reduce the deficit**:\n- Exceptionally strong economic growth boosting tax revenues\n- A political consensus emerging for spending cuts (unlikely but possible)\n- One-time revenue windfalls or accounting changes\n\nHowever, these positive scenarios are less probable than the baseline where structural spending growth and high interest costs push the deficit upward or keep it stable at historically high levels.\n\n**Conclusion**: The combination of automatic spending growth, rising interest costs, absence of expiring tax provisions during FY2025, and weak political incentives for deficit reduction makes a smaller deficit in 2025 unlikely.

The target threshold of $0.255 is approximately 70% below Dogecoin's all-time high of ~$0.73, but well above its typical trading range during 2022-2024.\n\nKey considerations:\n1. **Market cycle timing**: The prediction date (Nov 16, 2025) falls 19 months after Bitcoin's April 2024 halving. Historically, crypto bull markets peak 12-18 months post-halving, so this date could capture a potential market top.\n2. **Catalyst potential**: Elon Musk's potential integration of Dogecoin into X's payment system remains a significant upside catalyst, though its timing and implementation are uncertain.\n3. **Base rate analysis**: Dogecoin has spent most of its time below $0.255, with only brief periods above this level (primarily in 2021). The probability of exceeding this threshold on any random day is historically low (~15-20%).\n4. **Uncertainty**: 18-month crypto predictions are extremely uncertain due to regulatory changes, macroeconomic factors, and unpredictable sentiment shifts.\n\nWhile a 2025 bull market could push DOGE above $0.255, the base case suggests it will remain below this level. The threshold requires a sustained 60-second average, not just a brief spike, making it more difficult to achieve.

This is a future sporting event with inherent unpredictability, but several factors point toward Samsunspor being the favorite:\n\n1. **Home Advantage**: In soccer, home teams win approximately 45-50% of matches across major leagues, with Turkish S\u00fcper Lig showing particularly strong home-field effects. The venue alone gives Samsunspor a significant edge.\n\n2. **Team Quality Differential**: Eyupspor was newly promoted to the S\u00fcper Lig for the 2024-25 season. Even if they survive relegation, they would likely enter their second top-flight season as a lower-table team still building squad depth and top-tier experience. Samsunspor, as an established mid-table S\u00fcper Lig side, should have superior resources, squad quality, and institutional stability.\n\n3. **Timing**: A November fixture means the season will be well underway, reducing early-season variance. Both teams' form will be clearer, but Samsunspor's home consistency should be more reliable than Eyupspor's away performance.\n\n4. **Uncertainty Factors**: The 1.5-year timeframe introduces substantial unknowns: transfers, managerial changes, injuries, and form. This tempers confidence significantly.\n\n**Base Rate Adjustment**: While home teams generally win ~46% of Turkish league matches, the quality gap likely pushes this to ~55% for this specific matchup. However, soccer's inherent randomness (red cards, VAR decisions, individual errors) means even clear favorites lose frequently.\n\n**Conclusion**: Samsunspor is more likely than not to win, but far from certain. The probability is moderately above 50% but well below strong favorite territory.\n\n<answer>yes</answer>\n<confidence>55</confidence>",

      "raw_output": "The question asks whether Republicans will win Arizona's 7th Congressional District special election in 2025. To evaluate this, I need to consider the district's fundamentals and base rates for special elections.\n\nArizona's 7th District is a heavily Democratic seat with a Cook PVI of approximately D+15 to D+20. It includes Tucson and southwestern Arizona, with a majority-minority population that strongly favors Democrats. In recent elections, Democratic candidates have consistently won with about 64% of the vote.\n\nKey considerations:\n\n1. **Partisan lean**: D+15 districts are extremely safe. Even in special elections with lower turnout, the structural Democratic advantage is overwhelming. The district's demographics (majority Latino, urban/suburban Tucson) create a high floor for Democratic performance.\n\n2. **Base rates**: Historically, special elections in districts with this partisan lean almost never flip. Of recent special elections in D+15+ districts (CA-34, LA-02, OH-11), Democrats retained all of them by double-digit margins. The probability of a Republican victory in such a district is likely under 5% in a typical scenario.\n\n3. **Unknown vacancy**: The question doesn't specify why a special election would occur. If caused by scandal involving the Democratic incumbent, that could modestly increase Republican chances, but even scandal-plagued seats in D+15 districts rarely flip because partisan identity outweighs candidate-specific factors.\n\n4. **2025 context**: This is an off-year election, which typically means lower turnout. While this can increase variance, in heavily Democratic districts it usually means the Democratic base is sufficient to carry the seat regardless.\n\n5. **Candidate quality**: Even with an exceptional Republican candidate and a weak Democratic one, overcoming a D+15 lean would require a perfect storm of factors that is highly improbable.\n\nThe only plausible path to a Republican win would require simultaneous occurrence of: a major Democratic scandal, a national Republican wave, exceptional candidate quality differential, and unprecedented turnout patterns. The joint probability of all these factors is very low.\n\nGiven the district's strong Democratic fundamentals and the historical difficulty of flipping heavily partisan seats in special elections, the outcome is highly predictable.\n\n<answer>no</answer>\n<confidence>93</confidence>",

Japanese prime ministers have historically short tenures (averaging 2-3 years in recent decades), and Ishiba began with relatively low approval ratings, making him vulnerable.

Let me break down the key considerations:\n\n**Base Rate Analysis**: First Ladies rarely speak at executive order signings, and when they do, they typically avoid specific policy jargon. Melania Trump has maintained a relatively apolitical public profile focused on children's issues rather than domestic policy terms like \"welfare.\" The word \"welfare\" is a loaded political term that would be unusual for her to utter in this context.\n\n**Conditional Probabilities**:\n1. Event accessibility: While many EO signings are public, some are private. The \"not opened to press\" clause creates ~20% chance of automatic NO resolution.\n2. Melania speaking: Even if present, she may not speak at all (historically <30% chance she says more than brief pleasantries).\n3. Specific word usage: If she does speak, the probability she uses the exact term \"welfare\" is low unless the EO directly concerns her initiative. Her typical vocabulary favors phrases like \"helping children\" or \"supporting families\" rather than the technical term.\n\n**Key Uncertainty**: The topic of the executive order is unknown. If it concerns foster care or child welfare systems (tying to her \"Be Best\" initiative), the probability increases modestly. However, welfare policy is traditionally the President's domain.\n\n**Prior Pattern**: During the first Trump term, Melania did not speak at welfare-related announcements. Her public statements carefully avoided controversial policy terminology.\n\nCombining these factors: (0.8 public chance) \u00d7 (0.3 speaking chance) \u00d7 (0.15 word usage chance) \u2248 3.6% baseline. Even with uncertainty about the EO topic, this remains a low-probability outcome.\n\nThe balance of evidence strongly suggests she will not say this specific word, even if present at the signing.\n\n<answer>no</answer>\n<confidence>12</confidence>",
