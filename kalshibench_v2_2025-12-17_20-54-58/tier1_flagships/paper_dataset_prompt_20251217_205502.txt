## Dataset: KalshiBench

### What is KalshiBench?

KalshiBench is a benchmark for evaluating LLM forecasting calibration using real-world prediction markets from Kalshi, a CFTC-regulated prediction market platform. Unlike traditional benchmarks that measure accuracy on static knowledge, KalshiBench evaluates whether models can make well-calibrated probabilistic predictions on questions with verifiable real-world outcomes.

**Key Innovation:** By using temporally-filtered prediction market questions, we ensure models cannot have memorized the answers during training—the questions resolve AFTER the models' knowledge cutoffs.

## Writing Instructions

Write a formal Dataset section (2-3 paragraphs) suitable for NeurIPS Datasets & Benchmarks covering:

**Paragraph 1: Data Collection & Source**
- Describe Kalshi as the data source (CFTC-regulated, real money)
- Explain why prediction markets are valuable for forecasting evaluation
- Questions have real-world outcomes that can be objectively verified
- Mention temporal filtering to prevent data contamination

**Paragraph 2: Dataset Construction & Processing**
- Describe the two-step dataset creation process:
  1. Raw data extraction from Kalshi API
  2. Cleaning, deduplication, and standardization into KalshiBench dataset
- Explain that dataset is deduplicated by series_ticker to avoid related questions
- Note that only resolved binary yes/no markets are included

**Paragraph 3: Dataset Statistics & Characteristics**
- Report key statistics (size, categories, temporal span)
- Discuss label distribution and potential biases
- Describe question complexity metrics
- Note the category diversity (entropy measure)

**Key Points to Emphasize:**
1. Real-world grounding: Questions have real monetary stakes
2. Temporal integrity: Knowledge cutoff prevents memorization
3. Clean evaluation: Pre-processed, deduplicated dataset
4. Diversity: Multiple categories spanning politics, economics, science, etc.

Create a summary statistics table with the most important metrics.
